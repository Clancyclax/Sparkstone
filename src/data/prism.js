// ============================================================================
// ROUND 124 -- PRISM STUBBY, THE OTHER ONE WHO WOKE UP HERE.
//
// The user, in full:
//
//   "We need to add another character to the sewers. A woman, named Prism
//    Stubby, who appears next to you when you arrive. She is also confused and
//    from another world. Prism doesn't undertand whats going on and relys on
//    you to get out of the sewer following you around and running from any
//    monsters. If you respawn she does too.
//
//    Prism is somewhat scared, but determined and shouts out suggestions ...
//    Once you escape she is thankful and after you get to the surface she
//    heads to the adventurers society. After a day you can find her in the
//    adventure society building now in a full new set of armor.
//
//    Prism can be convinced to join the players party but has no essences,
//    allowing the player to effectively build a full 2nd character.
//
//    Prism is sarcastic and funny. Conversations with Prism about her life
//    back on earth reveal she grew up wrestling and learned Taekwondo. She's
//    worked as a teacher, a waitress, a bartender. Prism is funny and
//    sarcastic but also a little disorganized and unmotivated.
//
//    Her quest chain will be about figuring out what she wants her life to be
//    when she goes back to earth. Each region should have some quests around
//    trying a new job and trying to figure out how to cook. Her silver to gold
//    transition is embracing her confluence essence (whatever it is) and
//    realizing that this new world is a better fit for her anyway."
//
// WHY SHE IS HER OWN FILE. Everything about Prism is written text -- barks,
// dialogue, an arc -- and party.js is a roster of four builds. Putting a fifth
// person's entire voice in there would bury the builds; putting her build in
// here would put half of one character in two files. So the BUILD stays in
// party.js with the others and the VOICE lives here, which is the same split
// companionStory.js already makes for the other four.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT WRITING: she has no essences. Every other member
// of the roster arrives as a finished person with three essences and a
// confluence; Prism arrives as a person with nothing, and the player fills
// four slots with essences out of their own bag. See `_partySocketEssence`.

//
// Each has a TRIGGER rather than a timer. The user's own examples are all
// reactions -- to the water, to the traps, to her own interface, to a slime --
// and a line fired on a clock says them into an empty corridor.
