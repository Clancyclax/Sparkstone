// Shared isometric-projection math, ported 1:1 from sparkstone_prototype.html
// (see ISO_TW/ISO_TH/isoProject/isoUnproject/facingFromMove there). Keeping
// this identical is deliberate: every gameplay system stays in plain square
// "world" coordinates (movement, collision, distances, AI) and ONLY this
// module's isoProject() is used to figure out where something should be
// drawn. That's the exact split the original engine used, and it's why the
// migration doesn't have to re-derive any gameplay math -- only re-plumb it
// through Phaser GameObjects instead of raw canvas draws.
//
// IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL: in the original, isoProject()
// output went through a *manual* `camera.x/y` subtraction (worldToScreen)
// before hitting canvas draw calls. Here, isoProject() output is used
// directly as a Phaser GameObject's x/y -- i.e. "iso-space" IS this scene's
// coordinate space -- and Phaser's own Camera (scrollX/scrollY, startFollow)
// plays the role `camera.x/y` used to play. That's the one deliberate
// re-plumbing; the math itself is untouched.

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 187 -- MAP NORTH IS NOT OBJECT NORTH. THE RULE, WRITTEN DOWN.
//
// THE USER, after finding every fence on the aristocratic estates turned one
// eighth of a turn wrong:
//
//   "Due to the difference between true north and isometric north all objects
//    are partially offset. This should have been a known rule long ago, please
//    log that due to this that on the map north is for an object northeast, on
//    the map east is for an object southeast, map west is object northwest,
//    and map south is object southwest."
//
//   map north  ->  object NORTHEAST
//   map east   ->  object SOUTHEAST
//   map south  ->  object SOUTHWEST
//   map west   ->  object NORTHWEST
//
// AND IT FALLS STRAIGHT OUT OF isoProject ABOVE, which is why it should have
// been written down years of rounds ago instead of rediscovered per system.
// A step of one tile due east in world space is (+TILE, 0), and
// isoProject turns that into (+ISO_TW/2, +ISO_TH/2) -- down AND right on
// screen, which is screen southeast. The four world axes land on the four
// screen diagonals, every time:
//
//   world +x (map east)   ->  screen (+32, +16)  ->  southeast
//   world +y (map south)  ->  screen (-32, +16)  ->  southwest
//   world -x (map west)   ->  screen (-32, -16)  ->  northwest
//   world -y (map north)  ->  screen (+32, -16)  ->  northeast
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. Any time a system knows which way something faces or runs
// in MAP terms -- a wall along the north border, a fence down the east side of
// a property, a building fronting the south road -- it has to come through
// here before it becomes an art facing. town.js's `findBuildingFacing` already
// arrives at the same four by walking the world axes and snapping, and its own
// note observes that a screen cardinal "simply never gets selected by this
// particular search". That note describes the consequence; this is the cause,
// and now it has a name both can use.
//
// THE COST OF NOT HAVING HAD IT: round 187 laid 775 estate fence posts using
// the city wall's broadside/end-on pairing instead, and every one of them was
// a facing out. The wall's pairing is not wrong for the wall -- a wall course
// is chosen so its ENDS line up along the run (see town.js, round 80) -- but
// that is a question about the art, and this is a question about the compass.
// Two different questions that had been answered by one table.

 * ROUND 163 -- SMOOTH NOISE, because a per-tile hash is not a landscape.
 *
 * `tileVariantHash` is the right tool for "which of the six grass frames does
 * this tile draw" -- every tile independent, no structure at any scale. It is
 * the WRONG tool for deciding where a marsh is, and Bratugal's bog was built
 * with it: measured, the swamp band came out 70% grass, 19% bog and 8% water
 * with every tile rolled on its own, so it read as coloured static rather than
 * as pools and reed beds. Two consequences, and the second is why this exists.
 *
 *   1. You cannot see it. There is no marsh to look at, only speckle.
 *   2. A rule that asks "am I standing in bog" flickers on and off with every
 *      step, because the answer changes tile to tile. Round 77 met this with
 *      the water-walking bonus and wrote it down -- "which in play reads as
 *      the ability flickering as you walk" -- and patched around it by
 *      counting the accent tiles as footing too. A 50% movement slow cannot be
 *      patched around that way: it has to be somewhere you are, not something
 *      you strobe through.
 *
 * Value noise: hash the corners of a coarse grid, interpolate between them
 * with a smoothstep. Deterministic on (tx, ty) exactly as the hash is, so a
 * marsh is the same marsh every load, and built ON the same hash so there is
 * one source of randomness in the terrain rather than two.
 *
 * `cell` is the feature size in tiles -- how far apart the pools are.
