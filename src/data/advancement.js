// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 85 ITEM 2 -- WHAT THE GAME TELLS YOU WHEN YOU ADVANCE.
//
//   "Add new pop up text when certain actions are taken."
//
// Three moments, and the user wrote the templates:
//
//   2.1  absorbing an essence
//   2.2  bonding the fourth, and reaching iron rank
//   2.3  using an awakening stone
//
// WHY THIS IS A DATA MODULE AND NOT A METHOD ON THE SCENE. Every number in
// these messages is a claim about the character -- how many essences, what
// percentage, which attribute, how many of five abilities. A claim is a thing
// that can be wrong, and the way it goes wrong is that the text is written
// once against the state as it was and then the state changes underneath it.
// So the text is BUILT FROM a state snapshot by a pure function, and a suite
// can hand that function a made-up character and check every line without a
// browser, a world, or a fight.
//
// THE TEMPLATES ARE THE USER'S, punctuation included. Where a line needed a
// number they did not specify -- the percentage, the ability counts -- it is
// derived rather than invented, and `advancementFaults` asserts each template
// still contains the phrases they wrote.
