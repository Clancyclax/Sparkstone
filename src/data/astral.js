// ============================================================================
// ROUND 88 -- THE ASTRAL PORTALS, AND WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
//
// The user's ask, verbatim:
//
//   "Astral portals should be placed hidden in each region which take the
//    player to a very different environment maybe 1/3 the size of a region
//    map. This should often be the location of a cult, rare monsters and
//    nodes, and/or quest objectives."
//
// HOW YOU FIND ONE, and this is the answer that made the feature worth
// building rather than a fifth kind of landmark: AURA SENSE.
//
// Round 85 built `auraSenseTiles(rankIdx)` -- at Iron you feel living things
// ten tiles out through walls and dark, further at every rank above. It has
// been a combat convenience since the day it shipped. A portal that is
// invisible until your aura sense reaches it turns that number into a reason
// to rank up: the world does not get easier as you climb, it gets LARGER, and
// a Gold-rank character walking ground they cleared at Iron finds something
// that was there the whole time. Nothing else in the build rewards perception
// with content.
//
// So a portal is not marked, not on the map, and not mentioned by anybody. It
// is a thin place that you feel before you see.
//
// ONE PER REGION, four in the world, each a genuinely different environment --
// not a recoloured cave. The Nek's is a drowned shore under a dead sky;
// Ontaria's is an orchard that grew through the wrong side of something;
// Elehyd's is the inside of a storm; Bratugal's is the ash of a city that the
// astral kept after the world let it go.
//
// WHAT IS IN THEM, in the user's own order: a cult, rare monsters, nodes.
// `cultists.js` has held ten authored cults since round 78 and been imported
// by nothing -- the Society's third-star contracts (society.js) use five of
// them, and these use four more. Between the two features every cult in the
// file is finally somewhere.
// ============================================================================

import { CULT_BY_SLUG } from './cultists.js';
// ROUND 90 -- the node tier band. Imported rather than restated: the realms
// sit one rung above their region and there must be exactly one place that
// says so, or the two copies drift and the realm quietly stops being worth
// walking into.

/**
 * How big a realm is.
 *
 * The ask was "maybe 1/3 the size of a region map". A region is 1024 tiles a
 * side, so a third is 341, and 341 x 341 x 4 realms is 465,000 tiles of world
 * to reserve and paint. Two things bound it below that:
 *
 *   - The interior band is 128 rows and 44 of them are spare, so ANY realm
 *     needs the band grown; the growth also widens the world map's frame,
 *     which is why `_drawFlatMap` had to be pointed at WORLD_TILES.
 *   - A realm is stamped tile by tile. Doing four of them at world build would
 *     add over a million writes to a build round 43 already asserts should
 *     take about a second and which is currently taking three and a half.
 *
 * 224 is what those two allow: 22% of a region a side, four of them in a
 * 448x448 block, and each one STAMPED ON ENTRY rather than at build, so the
 * cost is paid by the player who walks through the portal and by nobody else.
 * It is smaller than the ask and it is not a room -- 50,176 tiles is twenty-
 * eight times the sewer, which takes eight to twelve minutes to walk.
