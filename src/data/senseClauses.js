// ROUND 216 -- MOVED OUT OF perception.js, WHICH IS GENERATED.
//
// This block was hand-written at the bottom of a file whose own first line
// says "GENERATED ... Do not edit by hand". It survived four rounds because
// nobody regenerated; the moment round 216 re-ran the generator to make
// echolocation a pulse, `senseEffectClauses` vanished and every importer
// failed to load the game at all.
//
// A generated file with hand additions is a trap that springs once, silently,
// on whoever next runs the generator. So the hand-written half lives here and
// perception.js goes back to being wholly generated.

//   "Strong rolling weight Iron rank effect 'the dark that looks back, and from
//    where'. This isn't anything ... the entire point of the 'Iron Rank
//    Effect' section is to explain what a move actually does."
//
// The rank line used to print the sense's label and its `adds` column, which
// is flavour written to be read after the mechanics, not instead of them. The
// line is now built from the rank's `mods` -- the fields the runtime reads --
// so every clause is a thing the game does, with its number.
