// ROUND 47 -- PER-ESSENCE RANK PROGRESSION.
//
// The user's brief, verbatim:
//
//   "Experience is split between the 4 essences. Each essence moves up through
//    Iron on it's own from 0% when it's first obtained and is iron 0 to 100%
//    when it's iron 1, this continues up through iron 9 to bronze 0. As earlier
//    stated moving past bronze 0 means all essences must have hit bronze. As
//    each essence moves up the abilities tied to that essence should minorly
//    increase. Examples, A skill that does 8 damage at iron 0 should be dealing
//    16 damage by iron 9. A movement speed buff that lasts 10 seconds at iron 0
//    should be lasting 20 seconds at iron 9, or perhaps the speed increase
//    moves from 10% to 20%. Remember additional aspects to each abilities are
//    unlocked at a rank change providing more opportunities for synergy."
//
//   "6.1) An essence can't start to rank up until all it's awakening stone
//    slots are filled."
//
// WHAT CHANGED, structurally. Rank used to be ONE number on the player,
// derived from banked xp (ranks.js rankForLevel). It still exists -- the
// tyranny of rank, the region gates and the monster scaling all read it -- but
// it is DERIVED now: the player's rank is the rank of their WEAKEST essence.
// That is what makes "moving past bronze 0 means all essences must have hit
// bronze" true by construction rather than by a separate check.
//
// Each of the four slots carries its own xp, its own rank and its own level
// 0-9 within that rank.

//
// The user's bug report:
//
//   "Player moving straight from Iron to Gold when meditating. Experience
//    should be harder each rank, and iron rank monsters should be worth almost
//    nothing by silver rank."
//
// Both halves were true, and measured before this change. A fully-socketed
// character, one hoarded bank, one press of M:
//
//   start   iron:0 iron:0 iron:0 iron:0    "0% into Iron 0"
//   after   gold:9 gold:9 gold:9 gold:9    "0% into Gold 9"
//
// THREE faults stacked to produce that, and each needed its own fix:
//
//   1. THE CURVE WAS FLAT. `XP_PER_ESSENCE_LEVEL` was one number for every
//      rank, so Iron -> Bronze and Silver -> Gold cost exactly the same 450 xp
//      per essence. Three ranks cost precisely three times one rank, which is
//      not a progression, it is a straight line with rank names written on it.
//
//   2. NOTHING DECAYED. A monster's xp is its type's `xp` field and nothing
//      ever read the player's rank, so a Panterimp Grey was worth thirty at
//      Iron and thirty at Gold. That is the second half of the report and it
//      lives in monsters.js, not here.
//
//   3. NO BOUNDARY. `recomputeSlot`'s loop walked as many ranks as the xp
//      allowed in ONE call, and the top rank then absorbed every surplus level
//      -- which is why the measurement above lands on Gold NINE rather than
//      Gold 0. See `fromRank` below.
//
// THE STEP IS THE ONE TUNING KNOB. Everything else is derived from it, so
// retuning the whole game's pacing is this single number.
// ===========================================================================
