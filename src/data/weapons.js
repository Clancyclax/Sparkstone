// Weapon essences, originally ported verbatim from ESSENCE_DEFS
// (sparkstone_prototype.html line ~1461-1465) -- the 5 melee weapon rows.
//
// ROUND 28 rewrote the numbers and added two weapons. The user's spec:
//
//   "Weapons should have variable ranges, in order from closest to farthest
//    away daggers, swords, warhammers, axes, scythes, whips. This should
//    ~reverse correlate to the weapon speed except for whips which should be
//    at roughly the same speed at the sword."
//
// Two consequences worth stating, because both invert something that was
// true before this round.
//
// 1. THE HAMMER IS NOW FASTER THAN THE AXE. It has to be: the user put
//    warhammers nearer than axes on the range ladder, and asked speed to
//    reverse-correlate with range. It is also right on its own terms -- a
//    warhammer IS a shorter weapon than a battleaxe. The hammer keeps its
//    identity through effects rather than raw numbers: it is still the only
//    weapon that stuns, and still strips the most Armor.
//
// 2. DAMAGE NOW SCALES WITH COOLDOWN, not with "heaviness". With range and
//    speed trading against each other, letting damage float freely would
//    make one weapon strictly dominant. Instead base damage is set so DPS
//    lands in a narrow band that declines gently as reach grows (reach is
//    worth paying for): ~21 dps at dagger range down to ~17 at scythe
//    range. What actually distinguishes weapons is SHAPE and EFFECTS.
//
// The whip is the deliberate exception the user carved out: the longest
// reach in the game at sword speed. It pays for that by being the only
// weapon that hits ONE target -- see `shape: 'lane'` below.
//
// --- attack shapes (round 28) --------------------------------------------
// The old hit test was distance + angular arc for every weapon. The user
// asked for genuinely different shapes, so `shape` now selects the test:
//
//   'cone'   dist <= range AND |angle to target| <= arc/2.
//            dagger (narrow forward stab), sword and axe (arc 180 = the
//            "half circle in front"), spear (narrow), scythe (arc 270 =
//            the "large sweep roughly 270 degrees around the player").
//   'square' a box directly in front: 0 <= forward <= range and
//            |lateral| <= width/2. The hammer's "square directly in front".
//   'lane'   a tile-wide lane straight ahead, and only the NEAREST monster
//            in it is hit. The whip's "targeted attack on the tile directly
//            in front of the player".
//
// On the whip's shape specifically: "the tile directly in front" and "the
// farthest range" pull against each other -- a literal adjacent tile would
// make the longest-reach weapon the shortest. Read together, the sense is a
// lash that snaps out along the facing and strikes one target, with a tile
// governing how WIDE the strike is rather than how far. That is what 'lane'
// implements: full reach, one tile of lateral tolerance, single target. If
// the intent was literally the adjacent tile, only WHIP.range changes.
//
// critChanceBonus/critDamageBonus (see src/data/combat.js for the base
// 1.5x/5% figures these stack on): a fast, precise weapon lands more crits
// than a slow heavy one; a heavy weapon hits harder when it does crit.

  // --- ROUND 74: THE RANGED FOUR ----------------------------------------
  //
  //   "Add bows, javelins, crossbows and staves"
  //
  // These are the first weapons in the game that do not resolve instantly.
  // Every weapon up to here is a geometric test run on the frame the button
  // is pressed -- `_weaponHitTargets` asks which monsters are standing in a
  // cone, a square or a lane RIGHT NOW and the answer is the hit list. A bow
  // cannot work that way: the arrow has to be in the air, it has to be
  // possible to miss because the target walked, and it has to stop at the
  // rock it flies into. So these carry `shape: 'shot'`, which routes the
  // swing through the projectile system the abilities already use rather
  // than through the hit test. `_weaponHitTargets` returns nothing for them,
  // which is correct and not a stub: a shot connects later or not at all.
  //
  // WHY THE DPS BAND IS LOWER THAN MELEE'S. The melee ladder lands 17-21 dps
  // and declines gently as reach grows, because reach is worth paying for.
  // These reach between 1.7x and 2.5x the longest melee weapon, and they do
  // it from outside a monster's own attack range, which is a bigger
  // advantage than any number on this page. They sit at 13-15 dps, and they
  // pay a second time in a way the melee ladder never does: a swing that is
  // aimed badly still sweeps SOMETHING, and a shot that is aimed badly hits
  // the ground.
  //
  // `shotSpeed` is world units per second and `shotRadius` is the collision
  // size of the missile -- deliberately separate numbers, because a fat
  // arrow is not a fast one (the same distinction the ability bolts make).
  // `range` is what it always was: how far the strike reaches. The scene
  // converts it to flight time, so a reach buff buys a longer shot for the
  // same reason it buys a longer sweep.

  // --- the ladder the user set for these four, verbatim -----------------
  //
  //   "1.1.1) Crossbows fire furthest, but fire slowest
  //    1.1.2) Bows occupy a middle range of speed and distance
  //    1.1.3) Staves fire the fastest but the range is only about twice that
  //           of the whip"
  //
  // Twice the whip's 120 is 240, and that is where the staff sits. The
  // javelin is nearer still, which the spec does not name but follows from
  // what it is: an arm, not a machine.
  //
  //   reach   javelin 200 < staff 240 < bow 260 < crossbow 300
  //   speed   staff 0.40 < bow 0.50 < javelin 0.70 < crossbow 1.20
  //
  // -- so within the ranged group speed and reach do NOT reverse-correlate
  // the way round 28's melee ladder does, and that is the user's own design:
  // a staff is both the fastest and the shortest, a crossbow both the slowest
  // and the longest. The two extremes are the ends of one axis (a machine
  // that must be spanned versus a wand that need only be pointed) rather than
  // a trade against reach.

  // The thrown spear, and a SUBTYPE OF SPEAR -- the user's 1.1.4: "Javelin
  // can use the spear assets and should be considered a subtype of spear."
  // `subtypeOf` is what says so to the rest of the game: it is what makes the
  // javelin draw from the spear bank, answer to a spear affinity, and count
  // as a spear wherever a spear is asked for.

//   "(note all 3 of these items are 2 handed and only 1 can be equipped at a
//    time.)"
//
// THE GAME HAD NO SUCH CONCEPT. Every weapon could go in either hand and both
// hands could hold one, which is how a character ended up able to fire two
// crossbows. `hands` is that concept, and it is on the weapon rather than in a
// list beside it for the reason `shape` is: a table of ids next to a table of
// weapons is two places to add the next weapon and one place to forget.
//
// The javelin is deliberately ONE-handed. It is a thrown spear
// (`subtypeOf: 'spear'`), a spear is one-handed here, and nothing about
// throwing one needs the other arm -- so a javelin-and-shield build is a real
// build, and the ranged shelf is not uniformly a commitment.
//
// The HAMMER and the SCYTHE are two-handed as well, by the user's answer when
// asked (see canBeWieldedOneHanded below). They are the melee half of the
// rule: a maul and a 270-degree scythe are swung with both arms, and being
// two-handed is what a Might-style ability would later be relaxing. The spear
// was offered and declined -- spear-and-shield is a build people already have.

 *    hand should be clarified to state that it allows the use of a 2 handed
 *    melee weapons. This would ensure to exclude the 3 new ranged weapons."
 *
 * WORTH SAYING PLAINLY: that ability does not exist in this build. Searched
 * for it across the generator, the runtime and every design document before
 * writing this -- there is no dual-wield relaxation, no `oneHand` lever, and
 * before this round no two-handed rule for one to relax. So there was nothing
 * to reword.
 *
 * What CAN be built now is the rule such an ability would have to read, so it
 * cannot be got wrong when it arrives. A one-handed exemption applies to a
 * weapon only if that weapon is two-handed AND NOT RANGED -- derived from
 * `shape`, so a ranged weapon can never qualify however the ability is
 * phrased. The user's "this would ensure to exclude the 3 new ranged weapons"
 * is enforced by construction rather than by remembering.
 *
 * WHAT IT APPLIES TO. Asked, because it was a balance change and not a
 * guess to be made here -- marking a melee weapon two-handed stops it being
 * dual-wielded and stops it pairing with a shield, which is a real nerf to
 * anyone already building on it. The user chose the SCYTHE and the HAMMER:
 *
 *     two-handed .................... hammer, scythe, staff, bow, crossbow
 *     a Might-style effect frees .... hammer, scythe
 *
 * The spear stays one-handed on purpose. It is a common early pick and
 * spear-and-shield is a build that exists; the javelin is a thrown spear and
 * inherits that. So the exemption now means something the day the ability is
 * written, and it can never reach the three ranged weapons, which was the
 * whole of the user's 5.1.
