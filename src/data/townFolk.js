// ROUND 98 -- THE PEOPLE IN THE TOWNS, AND WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
//
// THE USER:
//   "More color palette change ups for farmer and town NPCs."
//   "Remember hair and skin color can be important visual differences."
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS NOT bandits.js, AND WHY IT IS NOT ROUND 3's VARIANTS EITHER
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Round 3 gave ten NPC models two "soft variants" each by shifting the WHOLE
// sprite, which is why `npc_farmer_v1` reads as the same farmer in different
// light rather than as a different farmer. Round 95's bandits went the other
// way -- horizontal bands over the body, one colour per band -- which works for
// scrap armour and would put a green stripe across a face.
//
// The user named the two axes that actually distinguish one person from
// another, and they are the two neither of those systems has: SKIN and HAIR.
// So this file finds them and leaves everything else to the clothes.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE THING THAT TOOK THREE ATTEMPTS: WHAT COUNTS AS SKIN
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each attempt was measured by rendering a contact sheet and looking at it, and
// each failed differently:
//
//  1. BY HUE. Skin is warm, so select warm pixels. Straw hats, tan tunics and
//     brown leather are also warm, and the mask came back with the farmer's
//     entire hat and the peasant's entire shirt marked as skin.
//  2. BY FLOOD FILL FROM THE FACE. Better, until the flood ran down the neck
//     into the tunic on half the models -- there is no dark outline between a
//     chin and a collar on these sprites -- and swallowed the garment again.
//  3. BY HUE-CLUSTERING THE FACE'S COLOURS. This is the one that produced GREEN
//     FACES on five of six models, and the reason is worth keeping: A SKIN RAMP
//     CROSSES HUE BUCKETS. A lit cheek is more yellow than a shadowed one, so
//     clustering split every ramp in two and hue-rotated the half that fell in
//     the neighbouring bucket as if it were clothing.
//
// What works is boring and exact: an AUTHORED FACE BOX per model, read off the
// sprite on a pixel grid, and the skin ramp is the set of colours that box
// actually contains -- as exact RGB values, never as a range or a cluster. The
// same for the head band above it. And then nothing in either set may be
// recoloured as clothing, even where the same value also appears on a sleeve:
// protecting the face costs a little variety on the garment, and the reverse
// costs a face.
//
// This is bandits.js's own conclusion arrived at again -- author the per-model
// number, do not infer it -- which is why `chestTop` is a hand-written field
// there and `face` is one here.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Per model: the face box on frame 0 (x0, y0, x1, y1 inclusive), how many rows
 * above the face the head band reaches, and whether that band is HEADWEAR
 * rather than hair.
 *
 * The hat flag is not cosmetic bookkeeping. The band is found the same way
 * either way -- what is above the face -- but a hat may be any colour cloth
 * comes in and hair may not, so they draw from different pools. The farmer's
 * straw brim and the posh girl's lace cap are the two that would otherwise come
 * out of the tin as chestnut or ash blonde.
