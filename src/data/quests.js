// than typed as 500, because the ladder is the thing that defines it.
//
// Measured before: the smallest posting a board could actually print was a
// tier-0 survey on a slime -- round(8 xp * 2.4 * 1.6 * 0.85) = 26, times the

// --- ROUND 48: named bounties -------------------------------------------
// The user's ask, verbatim: "Bounties should get randomized names based on
// the type of creature and some scary sounding adjectives."
//
// Before this, a notice on the board read "Panterimp Grey (rank 2)" -- which
// is a species and a number, not a wanted poster. A bounty board in a world
// with bounty boards names the thing: someone came back from the Fens and
// said a word for what was out there, and the word stuck.
//
// THREE CONSTRAINTS shaped the design.
//
// 1. DETERMINISM. The quest board re-renders on every accept, turn-in and
//    open, and _renderQuestBoard rebuilds every row from scratch each time.
//    A name pulled from Math.random() would reshuffle under the player's
//    cursor mid-click. So the name is a pure function of the bounty's own
//    uid plus its family: same bounty, same name, forever, with no state to
//    keep and nothing to invalidate.
//
// 2. THE TYPE STAYS LEGIBLE. A player reading "The Gutspill Ravager" has to
//    still know what they signed up to fight. Two defences: several of the
//    patterns below name the family outright ("Blackmaw the Panterimp"), and
//    the board row keeps the plain monsterLabel visible alongside the name
//    regardless of which pattern came up (see _renderQuestBoard).
//
// 3. NO FORTY HAND-AUTHORED LISTS. One shared bank of scary vocabulary does
//    most of the work; each family only contributes a small FLAVOUR bank of
//    nouns and titles, and families that share a body plan share one bank --
//    six groups cover nineteen families. So undead get grave words and
//    beasts get claw/fang words without nineteen separate word lists to keep
//    in sync when a family is added.

// Shared scary bank. These are the first half of a compound name; the second
// half comes from the family's own flavour, which is what makes "Gutspill"
// (an ooze) and "Gutmaw" (a beast) out of the same prefix.

// The user: "we need to start generating significantly more quests. The bounty
// board should move from 'kill this monster' to more variations and should
// reset on a weekly basis as opposed to daily. Quests can lead to some of the
// locations that I discuss generating above..." And: "In addition to the main
// bounty board in the main city in each region the little scattered communities
// in each region should have a bounty board with 5 items, as well as a few NPC
// requests for questions, items, or support."
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A BOARD IS A SEED, NOT A LIST
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every board's postings are derived from `${boardKey}|${weekIndex}`. That is
// what makes the weekly reset trivial and, more importantly, what makes it
// HONEST: the same board shows the same six notices to the player all week, in
// the same order, whether they walk away and come back, save and reload, or
// leave the panel open through midnight. Nothing has to be stored for that to
// be true, so nothing can drift.
//

//   cull   -- volume. Kill N of a family anywhere; progresses off ordinary
//             play rather than sending you to a marker.
//   survey -- go and look at a named landmark. This is the "quests can lead to
//             some of the locations" ask, in its most direct form.
//   delve  -- clear what lives inside a named cave. The round-64 dens made
//             this answerable.
//   gather -- bring back N of a monster part. A reason to fight a species you
//             would otherwise walk past.
//   relic  -- bring back a specific awakening stone. Slow, and deliberately so:
//             it is the one posting a player may carry for a whole week.

// Wording throughout follows the standing rule: the TITLE carries the flavour,
