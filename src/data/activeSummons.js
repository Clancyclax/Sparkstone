// ============================================================================
// ROUND 59 -- ACTIVE SUMMONS
//
// The user's ask, verbatim:
//
//   "the development of a set of 'active' summons. Creatures, turrets, traps,
//    and generally short lived summons that have high damage. These should last
//    30 seconds to 3 minutes and have cooldowns of 2 minutes to 10 minutes. the
//    shorter the duration and longer the cooldown the stronger the summon
//    should be."
//
// WHY THIS GAP EXISTED, measured: the round-58 Pareto put Summon at 10.6% of
// every generated kit -- the second largest function in the game -- and all
// 4,251 of them across 2,000 kits were PASSIVE. A bonded familiar, a conjured
// weapon, conjured armour, conjured gear. There was no such thing as a summon
// you cast. An entire tenth of the ability roster had one mood.
//
// THE TRADE, which is the whole design
//
// The user gave a rule rather than numbers: shorter life and longer cooldown
// means stronger. That is a statement about CONCENTRATION -- the same value
// packed into less time and paid for with more waiting. So power is derived
// from both axes rather than rolled independently of them, and the two bands
// are the user's own: 30s-3min of life, 2-10min of cooldown.
//
// A summon that lives three minutes on a two-minute cooldown is nearly always
// out and correspondingly mild. One that lives thirty seconds on a ten-minute
// cooldown is a decision you make once a fight and feel.
