// ============================================================================
// ROUND 64 -- WHAT IS INSIDE THE CAVE.
//
// The user: "Lets get the quests and cave interiors established." And, from the
// same message, the shape of the best one: "a blood cult hideout that is hidden
// inside what from the outside looks like a normal barn".
//
// A landmark with a door in it that does not open is worse than a landmark with
// no door. Round 63 put twenty-four cave mouths, barns and shrines in the world
// and every one of them was scenery. This makes them rooms.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS REUSES THE ROUND-22 INTERIOR SYSTEM WHOLE
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// interiors.js already solved this problem, and solved it well: a room is a
// walled rectangle of ordinary world tiles standing in a reserved band past the
// last region, and a door is a teleport between a doorstep outside and an entry
// pad inside. The player never leaves WorldScene, so inventory, essences,
// abilities, combat, the minimap and the shop screen all work indoors for free.
// That reasoning is written out at length at the top of interiors.js and it
// applies to a cave exactly as it applied to a smithy.
//
// So a den is an INTERIOR_ROOM like any other. What is new is only:
//
//   * the rooms are a generic POOL, claimed at world-build time by whichever
//     sites got placed, because sites are procedural and rooms have to exist
//     before the band is laid out;
//   * a den's door hangs off a SITE'S STRUCTURE rather than off a singleton
//     town building, which is the one thing the round-22 door code could not
//     already do;
//   * and the dressing is the round-64 palette: recoloured rock and tree props
//     standing inside the room, which is what makes a cave read as "a pocket
//     dimension very inclined to a single element" rather than as a dark
//     rectangle with barrels in it.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * The pool.
 *
 * Sized off what the world actually places: measured at 24 structure-bearing
 * sites, plus the hidden lairs this round adds, plus room to grow. A room in
 * the pool that nobody claims costs a floor rect and a wall ring in a corner of
 * the map no player will ever stand in, so the pool is deliberately generous --
 * running OUT would mean two caves sharing an interior, which is the one
 * outcome worth spending a few unused rectangles to avoid.
