// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 203 (item 5) -- TRANSCENDENT DAMAGE, IN FULL.
//
// The user's properties, verbatim:
//
//   "Armor-Ignoring: It bypasses standard physical and magical defenses,
//    making it devastatingly effective regardless of a target's toughness.
//    Specialized Source: It is frequently associated higher-tier cosmic or
//    divine forces.
//    Immunity & Resistance Bypassing: Powers dealing transcendent damage
//    cannot easily be mitigated or redirected by conventional
//    resistance-shifting or retributive skills like Instant Karma.
//    Notably Transcendent damage ignores rank disparity.
//    It always looks like bright blue/white glowing light burning reality
//    itself.
//    At ranks below Silver Transcendent damage is very rare and requires
//    either narrow conditions or significant setup.
//    Even at Silver and Gold transcendent damage is rare but won't have the
//    tight restrictions it carries at iron or bronze rank."
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THIS OVERRULES A CALL ROUND 201 MADE, and it is worth writing down rather
// than quietly flipping.
//
// Round 201 gave transcendent damage the armour and resistance bypass and
// DELIBERATELY kept it subject to the rank gap, on the reasoning that armour,
// resistance and a ward are DEFENCES an ability can be written to beat, while
// the rank gap is round 43's statement that a Normal hunter and a Gold beast
// are different categories of thing. That reasoning is sound and it is not
// what the books say. "Notably Transcendent damage ignores rank disparity" is
// the user's ruling and it is now the rule.
//
// The consequence is real and is the reason the rarity half of this file
// exists: an iron-rank character holding a transcendent ability can hurt
// ANYTHING in the world. Round 43's tyranny of rank is the load-bearing wall
// of the whole world design -- super packs you have outgrown, a solo of the
// rank above you as a genuine threat, gate guards who refuse an under-ranked
// player. One ability that walks around it is a hole in all of that.
//
// So the gating below is NOT flavour and is not a guideline. Under silver a
// transcendent ability carries a GATE, and its damage is transcendent only
// while that gate is satisfied; the rest of the time it lands as its ordinary
// element. That is the mechanical reading of "requires either narrow
// conditions or significant setup", and it is enforced in the damage path
// rather than trusted to the generator.

// or bronze", and it means a player meets the ability at iron, learns what it
// wants, and is rewarded at silver by no longer having to arrange it.
