// ROUND 53 -- LEVER REPERTOIRES AND THE BUILD'S SPINE.
//
// The user, after reading ten randomly drawn builds:
//
//   "The idea is probably to have a larger set of levers for each essence and
//    then based on the 3 essences and confluence essences it identifies a set
//    of mostly shared levers to promote synergy. This actually is lore
//    appropriate as well, people are warned not to absorb too many awakening
//    stones before they get all their essences or their build may end up
//    disjointed."
//
// This is the answer to a problem three rounds of work could not reach from the
// generator side. Measured in round 52: two builds sharing ONE essence in three
// still overlapped ~74% of their shapes, because `bind` sits on 40% of the 146
// essences and `ward` on 35%. A lever carried by a third of the catalogue wins
// a third of the catalogue's sockets no matter what else is socketed, and no
// amount of candidate scoring reaches that -- it is a property of the DATA.
//
// The fix is not to re-author 146 motifs. It is to change what a lever list
// MEANS:
//
//   BEFORE  an essence's levers were the levers it uses. Fixed, always, in
//           every build, regardless of what it was bonded alongside.
//
//   AFTER   an essence's levers are the levers it CAN reach -- a repertoire.
//           Which of them it actually uses is decided by the company it keeps.
//
// So a Fire essence in a trio that agrees on `burst` is an explosive Fire; the
// same Fire essence beside two essences that agree on `linger` is a smouldering
// one. Same essence, different build, genuinely different abilities. And two
// trios that share nothing with each other now diverge hard, because their
// spines are different -- which is the separation problem, solved at the layer
// it actually lives on.
//
// THE LORE FALLS OUT OF IT RATHER THAN BEING PAINTED ON. A build coheres when
// its three essences agree. Bond three essences that agree on nothing and the
// generator has no spine to build around -- exactly the disjointed build the
// in-world warning describes. See COHERENCE below: that outcome is real, it is
// worse, and the UI says so.

/**
 * What each stone/essence FAMILY can reach for, beyond its authored core.
 *
 * The authored `levers` in essenceMotifs.js stay exactly as they are -- they
 * are the essence's core, its most characteristic mechanics, and several were
 * written by the user personally. This table adds the levers a family could
 * plausibly extend INTO when the rest of the build asks it to. An essence never
 * uses one of these on its own; it only reaches for one that its trio agrees on.
 *
 * Keyed by family rather than by essence for a reason beyond effort: the family
 * is what an essence has in common with its neighbours, so extending through it
 * keeps Ape and Bear reaching for the same NEIGHBOURHOOD while their authored
 * cores keep them distinct. Extending through lever-adjacency instead would
 * have done the opposite -- every ward essence reaching for the same two levers
 * regardless of what it is -- which is the concentration this file exists to
 * break, rebuilt one layer down.
 *
 * THE TABLE COUNTERBALANCES THE CORES RATHER THAN MIRRORING THEM, and the
 * first draft got this exactly backwards. Measured, core frequency across the
 * 146 authored motifs runs bind 58, ward 51, linger 41 at the top and turn 2,
 * renew 1 at the bottom. A first pass that extended each family into whatever
 * suited it thematically reproduced that shape one layer up: `bind` landed on
 * 43% of all spines and `renew` on none, so the build-level fix inherited the
 * exact concentration it was written to break. So the dominant seven (bind,
 * ward, linger, swift, stalk, reach, shift) appear here only where a family
 * would be a lie without them, and the scarce end carries the weight.
 *
 * `renew` is deliberately spread across six families here (aquatic, water,
 * light, life, blood, craft -- a craft stone's mending label is already
 * "Repair"). The user: "Renew being the only way to generate hots is
 * a weakness. The right awakening stones in a blood essence should generate
 * abilities that deal damage and generate a heal over time for a percentage of
 * damage dealt." Blood reaching `renew` through its trio is that sentence in
 * data form.
