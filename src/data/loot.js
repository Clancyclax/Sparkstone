// ROUND 82 ITEM 3 -- LOOT ON THE FLOOR.
//
//   "Loot needs an overhaul, coins should be picked up automatically but
//    everything else should drop in a standard ARPG format where the player
//    can choose to pick the items up."
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Until this round exactly one thing in the game ever
// touched the ground: a coin pip. Every other drop -- essences, awakening
// stones, monster parts, potions, gear -- was pushed straight into the
// backpack at the moment of the kill, and the player found out about it from
// a line of float text ending in "(bag)". Six separate call sites did their
// own `inventory.<kind>.push(...)`, which is why `_rollSiteFind` carries a
// comment explaining that it grants directly because "there is no
// world-pickup path for essences and stones". There is one now.
//
// THE SHAPE OF A DROP is deliberately one type with a `kind` discriminator
// rather than five parallel arrays. Everything a drop has to do -- draw an
// icon, colour a label by rarity, sit on the floor, be picked up, be counted
// by a suite -- is the same job for a potion and for a legendary sword. The
// only thing that differs is which container it lands in, and that is one
// switch in `grantLootToPlayer` below.
//
// COINS ARE NOT IN HERE. They already behaved the way the user asked for --
// spawned on the ground, vacuumed up on approach -- so that path is untouched.
// The one change coins get is that the vacuum radius is now theirs alone
// (LOOT_MAGNET_RADIUS), separate from the reach at which an item offers
// itself, because those two numbers answer different questions and had been
// the same constant by accident.
// ===========================================================================
