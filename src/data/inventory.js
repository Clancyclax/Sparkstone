// Restored equipment/inventory/currency system, round 4. The user's own
// words: "the original inventory screen allowing the player to attach
// essences and awakening stones, showed the attributes 'Power, Spirit,
// Speed, and Recovery' had an actual inventory and equipment slots, this
// also tracked your the players currency in the various coins need to be
// restored... essence stones added back in, awakening stones, monster
// drops, coins, and the inventory screen from before."
//
// Ported CONCEPTS from sparkstone_prototype.html (the canonical 22MB
// original, NOT the differently-named/older sparkstone_prototype_5.html
// upload): COIN_RANKS/COIN_CONVERSION (line ~1686), ATTR_NAMES (line
// ~2838), the RESOURCE_BASE idea that Power/Spirit/Speed feed max HP/Mana/
// Stamina (line ~2849), bindEssenceAttribute/unbindEssenceAttribute (an
// essence equipped into a slot randomly binds that slot to one of the 4
// attributes, granting a flat bonus for as long as it's equipped).
//
// DELIBERATE SCOPE CUTS from the original (documented per this project's
// own practice of flagging rather than silently faking a descoped feature):
//   - Only 3 essence slots (ESSENCE_SLOT_COUNT), not the original's 4
//     (3 real + a "confluence" 4th slot that auto-combines all 3 into a
//     procedurally generated ability). The confluence mechanic needs the
//     original's full computeAbility/generateVastAbility machinery, which
//     this port never built (see abilities.js's own header note: only 4 of
//     ~18 templates exist here). With 3 slots and 4 attributes, one
//     attribute is always left unbound at any given time -- an accepted
//     simplification, not a bug.
//   - Awakening stones do NOT share the essence id-space or generate new
//     procedural abilities the way they do in the original (there, a stone
//     is just another essence/elemental id socketed alongside the main one,
//     and the PAIR determines the generated ability). This port's 5-essence
//     roster doesn't map onto that system at all, so STONE_DEFS below is a
//     separate, independent catalog: flat, fixed bonuses to whichever
//     slot's bound attribute the stone is socketed into, nothing procedural.
//   - No gear/armor paperdoll (helmet/chest/legs/boots/gauntlets/
//     accessories) -- the user's own ask named "essences and awakening
//     stones" specifically as what needed restoring, not armor slots.
//     player.gearCritChance/gearCritDamage (the existing GEAR_ROLL_CHANCE
//     stand-in from an earlier round) are left as they were.

// ROUND 58 -- FOUR RESOURCE FORMULAS LIVED HERE AND NONE OF THEM RAN.
//
// `computeMaxHp`, `computeMaxMana`, `computeMaxStamina` and `computeRegenMult`
// were exported from this file and imported by nothing. Round 10's minor-stat
// system took the whole job -- stats.js `computeMinorStats` is the only path
// that has produced a player's maxima since -- and these were left behind.
//
// Three of them were merely redundant. `computeRegenMult` was worse than that:
// it returned `1 + recovery * 0.25`, a MULTIPLIER on some base rate, where the
// live code adds a flat rate to a base of zero for health and 1.5%/s for the
// other two pools. Anyone reading this file to understand Recovery -- which is
// reasonable, since this is where attributes are defined -- would come away
// with the wrong model of the attribute entirely.
//
// Deleted rather than corrected: a second implementation that agrees today is
// the one that disagrees after the next retune. This round's 4x rescale is
// exactly the sort of change that would have broken them again silently.
//
// The attribute -> stat map lives in stats.js `ATTR_SCALE`, and the totals that
// feed it come from `computeAttrTotal` below.

// Total attribute value for `attr` under the ROUND 6 economy (see the
// header note above): bond point + rank steps + ability-granted points.
// The rank bonus applies to every attribute unconditionally ("the
// attributes should EACH go up by 1"), the bond point only while an
// essence slot (or the formed confluence, slot 3) is actually bonded to
// this attribute, and ability points come from passiveMods.attrBonus --
// aggregated by WorldScene._recomputeDerivedStats BEFORE this is called.
// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 77 (item 6.2.1) -- THE ATTRIBUTE CAP.
//
// The user: "Previously noted was an attribute cap, which if the build doesn't
// role any of the above should cap at gold ranks 4, but with the right
// abilities (or divine items) could go as high as 6."
//
// THE FLOOR WAS ALREADY RIGHT AND NOTHING ENFORCED IT. `computeAttrTotal` is
// `(bound ? 1 : 0) + rankStepsPastIron(rank) + abilityBonus`, so a bound
// attribute at Gold is 1 + 3 = 4 before any ability touches it -- exactly the
// number the user names. What was missing is that `abilityBonus` had no
// ceiling at all: `attr_boost` granted `1 + rankStepsPastIron(rank)`, four more
// at Gold, so one such ability took a bound attribute to 8 and two took it to
// 12. Against a system where round 58 moved saturation to ~4.1 points and the
// user's own note says "a character will get so few attribute points they
// should be more impactful", 12 is not a big number, it is a broken one.
//
// So there are two caps and they are different things:
//
//   ATTR_SOFT_CAP (4)   where a build with no attribute abilities stops. It
//                       is not enforced as a clamp -- it is simply what the
//                       rank ladder adds up to, and it is written down here so
//                       the number has a name and a suite can assert it.
//   ATTR_HARD_CAP (6)   the ceiling nothing passes. Two more than the floor,
//                       which is the user's "as high as 6".
//
// Each attribute ability bound to an attribute raises THAT attribute's ceiling
// by one, and each divine item that names it raises it by one, to the hard
// cap. So the ability is not "+1 attribute" bolted onto a fixed ladder -- it
// is permission to go one point further than a build without it can, which is
// what makes taking two of them, or one plus a divine relic, a real choice.
// ===========================================================================
