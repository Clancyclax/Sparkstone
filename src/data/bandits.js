// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 95 -- THE BANDIT CREWS.
//
// The user, on the second star's escort contract: "guarding a shipment from
// bandits instead of monsters" -- and, on where the people come from:
//
//   "reuse both cultist and NPC adventurer art. Palette adjustments should be
//    multicolor patchwork gear instead of cults monochromatic look."
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MONOCHROME MEANS YOU BELONG TO SOMETHING. PATCHWORK MEANS YOU DO NOT.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// cultists.js's own header makes the case for one colour per cult: "the colour
// IS the build", so a red cultist bleeds you and a grey-green one raises what
// it kills, and the player reads the room before the fight starts. That works
// because a cult issues robes.
//
// A bandit crew issues nothing. What a bandit is wearing is what came off
// somebody else, and the whole visual argument of this file is that the player
// should be able to tell those two kinds of enemy apart across a field without
// reading a name: one silhouette is a single saturated colour, the other is
// five colours that do not go together. So the patchwork is not decoration --
// it is the same information channel the cults use, saying the opposite thing.
//
// WHICH IS WHY THE SCRAPS ARE THE POINT. Painting each body band ONE colour was
// tried first and it does not read as patchwork; it reads as a person in
// different clothes. Each band therefore carries TWO colours, chosen per
// three-pixel block by a hash of the position, so a garment is visibly sewn out
// of pieces. Three pixels because these are 64px figures: at one the checker
// dissolves into noise at play scale, at six a tunic is two flat halves.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND WHAT IT COST TO GET WRONG
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Four passes, each looking at the rendered figures rather than at the code:
//
//   1. One colour per band            -- reads as "different clothes". Rejected.
//   2. Two-colour scraps, muted bank  -- reads on the pale cultist models and
//                                        disappears on the adventurers, whose
//                                        art is already muted brown and green.
//                                        The bank got louder.
//   3. A head band                    -- dyes HAIR, and on the pale-haired
//                                        models it crept onto the face. Cut:
//                                        a bandit wears looted gear, not dyed
//                                        hair, which also removes the whole
//                                        "did it paint her face" question
//                                        rather than tuning around it.
//   4. A shared chest-band top of 14  -- the cultist woman's FACE is drawn at
//                                        y14-22, exactly where every other
//                                        model's collar is. She came out with a
//                                        green face three tries running. The
//                                        top of the chest band is a property of
//                                        the model now, and it is the one number
//                                        in this file that was arrived at by
//                                        zooming in on a sprite.
//
// Skin is NOT detected by hue. It cannot be: the base models are desaturated
// and the cult variants are monochrome, so on a blood-cult sheet a face is red
// and on a base sheet it is grey. What protects skin is the band table -- the
// head is never painted, and the hands sit inside the glove band on purpose,
// because a bandit with wrapped hands is a bandit.
