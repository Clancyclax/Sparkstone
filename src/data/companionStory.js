// ROUND 76 (item 9) -- THE COMPANIONS HAVE INSIDES NOW.
//
// STATUS_QUESTS_AND_STORY.md, on what four named characters amounted to:
//
//   "HANDOFF's 'faces, kits, and no interiority' is accurate.
//      Zeke Clark            8 lines (incl. the whole farm job)
//      Encykla Britanika     3
//      Ædia Britanika        3
//      Benjamin Iskarys      3
//    The three sisters and Benjamin join by walking within 150 units. After
//    that, talking to any of them returns a STAT READOUT -- role, rank, hit
//    points, four ability names -- not a line of character.
//    There is no banter system of any kind: no inter-companion dialogue, no
//    reactions to locations, no reaction to Act 1 events."
//
// The user wrote the four backstories themselves and they are followed
// closely, quoted where the wording is theirs:
//
//   9.2  Zeke "lost his wife to monsters about a year prior, he is haunted
//        that he couldn't save her, and became an adventurer as she always
//        wanted him to."
//   9.3  The Britanica sisters "were slaves in Bratugal, they ran when they
//        reached iron rank and their control devices were purged. They want
//        to reach gold rank in order to shut down the jungle slave market."
//   9.4  Benjamin is "secretly a noble of Vitesse, his family are solo
//        hunters, his kit is so defensive he is seen as a failure, he was
//        exiled and his name magically taken, and he has no childhood
//        memories." The user: he is "the emotional core, positive despite
//        it".
//
// ============================================================================
// HOW IT WORKS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY
// ============================================================================
//
// AN ARC, NOT A DIALOGUE TREE. Each companion has an ordered list of things
// they will tell you, and talking to them gives you the next one. No choices,
// no branches: the player's only input is that they keep coming back, which is
// the whole of what earns somebody's history in practice. A tree would have
// meant writing four times the lines to have three quarters of them never
// read, and a tree with no real choices is a list wearing a costume.
//
// GATES ARE STATED IN THE DATA. A step can require a `rank` or a `region` or a
// `flag`, so Zeke does not tell you about his wife in the first five minutes
// and the sisters do not talk about Bratugal until you have been there. The
// gate is a property of the STEP rather than a rule in the scene, so adding a
// beat later is a data edit.
//
// AND WHEN THE ARC RUNS OUT they say something ordinary. A companion who
// repeats their last confession every time you press E has not been given
// interiority, they have been given a stuck record. `idle` is a small bank of
// in-character nothings, which is what people mostly say.
//
// BANTER IS A PAIR, NOT A MONOLOGUE. Two companions, two lines, fired while
// walking. It needs BOTH of them recruited and it names them explicitly, which
// is what makes the twins' rivalry -- authored in party.js since round 44 as
// `elder: true` and read only by the rank-offset maths -- something the player
// can actually hear.
