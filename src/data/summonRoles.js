// ROUND 76 (item 2) -- MINION BUILDS: THE CAP, THE CEILING, AND ONE JOB EACH.
//
// The user:
//
//   "much like a build may through essences and awakening stones tend to be
//    more attack, healing, stealth, or defensive focused it may also be more
//    summon focused. Not every build needs multiple summons, but it should be
//    very possible for a build to end up with 6-8 constant summons and 2-4
//    short duration summons and be a 'Minion build'. Henrietta Geller in the
//    lore is one of these adventurers."
//
// and, asked what the ceiling should be:
//
//   "cap 8, damage should be scaled to the players rank and power. No summon
//    should hit harder than a monster at the same rank. They should have
//    plenty of variation, auras, heals, attacks, spells, dots, but each
//    summon can really only do 1 of these things."
//
// Three rules, and the third is the interesting one.
//
// ONE JOB EACH. Before this round every summon was the same summon: it walked
// at the nearest enemy and hit it. A board of eight identical dots hitting the
// same wolf is not a minion build, it is one ability cast eight times. Giving
// each summon exactly ONE of five jobs is what makes eight of them read as a
// menagerie -- and the restriction matters more than the variety does. A
// summon that attacked AND healed AND carried an aura would be strictly better
// than three summons that each do one thing, and the cap would then be a
// formality rather than a decision.
//
// THE CEILING IS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. "No summon should hit harder than a
// monster at the same rank" is a testable sentence, so the ceiling is computed
// from the actual roster rather than typed in. Measured across all 155
// monsters (tier maps to rank through COIN_RANK_BY_TIER):
//
//     rank      n    min   median   max
//     normal    5      3        4     4
//     iron     14      4        6     7
//     bronze   28      6       10    13
//     silver   42     12       16    20
//     gold     66     17       30    67
//
// The MEDIAN is the ceiling, not the max. A gold-rank max of 67 is the wyrm,
// and a summon that hits as hard as the strongest thing in the game would make
// the rule meaningless. The median is what "a monster at the same rank" means
// to a player, who meets the ordinary ones far more often than the apex.
//
// EIGHT PERMANENT, FOUR TEMPORARY. The temporary ones are counted separately
// because they are a different decision: a permanent summon is a slot in your
// build, a short-lived one is a button you press in a fight. Sharing one cap
// would mean casting a 20-second creature silently evicted a minion you had
// been maintaining, which is the kind of thing a player never sees happen and
// cannot explain afterwards.
