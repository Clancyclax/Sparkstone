// ============================================================================
// ROUND 90 -- CRAFTING. The machine, built from CRAFTING_SPEC.md.
//
// The user's original ask, and it is worth keeping at the top because every
// decision below answers some part of it:
//
//   "Based on the quintessence available, and various metals, woods, fibers,
//    and monster parts players should be able to have the blacksmith or
//    armorsmith create them items. The quintessence used should drive the
//    stats and effects on the weapons or gear created. Obviously the power,
//    quantity, and overall complexity of the effects should be rank gated.
//    This grants players a way to build on or reinforce their build synergies."
//
// And round 90's ruling on MONSTER CORES, verbatim:
//
//   "They are critical for setting the items rank, but also may require a 5-30
//    of them to create the item. Monster cores should be stackable in
//    inventory. They don't replace any other ingredient in craft, just
//    additional."
//
// THE ONE SENTENCE: you bring a crafter a FRAME (what the thing is), STOCK
// (what its body is), CORES (what rank it may reach) and QUINTESSENCE (what it
// does), and they hand you back an item whose effects were chosen by the
// quintessence rather than rolled by the game.
//
// WHY THIS FILE IMPORTS ALMOST NOTHING. The effect resolver's whole design is
// that it does NOT own a second effect table: it asks `thematicDebuffsFor` --
// the same function awakening.js asks when it decides what an ability may
// inflict -- so a Fire quintessence offers burn and sunder because fire
// ABILITIES offer burn and sunder. Add a debuff to debuffs.js and every
// quintessence that should reach it reaches it that day. That structural
// promise is the reason `expose` was written into debuffs.js in this same
// round rather than into this file.
