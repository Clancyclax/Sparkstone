// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 82 -- THE SEWER. The game's new opening.
//
//   "The player awakes in a large sewer surrounded by the skeletal remains of
//    a cult lets say a cult trying to summon a being from the astral."
//
//   "Instead of knowledge explaining everything to them right away the player
//    is forced to explore. A maze of tunnels, but if the player follows the
//    water they go the right direction."
//
// WHY THIS IS AN ASCII MAP AND NOT A GENERATOR.
//
// A generated maze can be solvable and still not be *readable*: the whole
// design rests on one promise -- follow the water and you are going the right
// way -- and that promise has to be true at every junction, which is a
// property of the specific layout rather than of the algorithm that made it.
// Authoring it means the route is visible in the source, the dead ends are
// deliberate, and the user can move a wall by typing a character.
//
// It is also the only representation where the water route can be CHECKED.
// `sewerFaults()` below walks the map and asserts the promise mechanically:
// every junction on the true path has water adjacent, no dead end does, and
// the exit is reachable. A maze whose signpost lies in one corridor is worse
// than a maze with no signpost at all.
//
// THE LEGEND
//   #  wall (drawn as void -- unlit stone, and free: the renderer already
//      draws TILE_VOID, so the maze costs no sprites at all)
//   .  wet brick walkway
//   ~  the channel. Impassable, because `isWaterTile` answers true for it,
//      which means every mover in the game already refuses to enter it.
//   S  where the player wakes, in the ritual circle
//   X  the ladder out, in the final chamber
//   C  the cultist
//   A  the rift into the astral (ROUND 92) -- shut until the prologue is over
//   w  a weapon on the floor      a  a piece of armour
//   p  a potion                   e  an essence or stone
//   s  a slime
//   b  a bone pile (scenery, the cult's remains)
//   W  the FIRST SWORD (ROUND 115) -- the one the player used to start holding
//   g  the slime standing over it, at half the strength of the others
//   ^  a standing hazard (ROUND 115): it hurts whatever walks onto it, and
//      what walks onto it is as often a slime as it is the player
//
// THE ROUTE, for anyone reading the map rather than the code: the channel
// leaves the ritual circle at the top left, runs east along the top, turns
// south down the middle of the map, and empties into the cultist's chamber at
// the bottom right. Every corridor that touches the channel is on the way.
// Every corridor that does not is a dead end with something in it -- which is
// the other half of the deal, and the reason exploring is worth doing.
// ===========================================================================

// The cultist in the last room is a member of one of the ten authored cults,
// not a bespoke antagonist -- see SEWER_CULTIST below. cultists.js is pure
// data and imports nothing, so this cannot form a cycle.

// to six moves the chamber up with it; and twenty rooms instead of thirty-five
// is the "easier pathing" half, because a shorter maze is one with fewer

 *
 * A SQUARE, not a circle, because the maze is drawn on squares: a circular
 * falloff makes a straight corridor appear to bulge in the middle. Chebyshev
 * distance is the same shape as the thing being lit.
 *

 * a picture of a maze. The channel only means anything -- "follow the water and
 * you are going the right direction" -- if the alternative is not knowing, and
 * until this round the player could see every dead end in the chamber they

// the viewport and paints it lit, remembered, or not at all. Lit was
// 0xffffff -- which is to say, "lit" meant "as bright as the art was drawn",
// and the only darkness in the maze was the part you could not see.

// SEWER_GLOOM is what lit means now. It is also what makes a torch mean
// anything: there is nothing for a light to add to white, so item 4.3's two
// halves are one change and this constant is the first half of it.
//
// SEWER_DIM comes down with it. 0x7e was "remembered" measured against a lit

// within a hair of each other and stops the fog drawing the distinction it
// exists to draw. 0x4a against 0x8e is the ratio 0x7e held against 0xff.
//
// HERE RATHER THAN IN THE SCENE because a suite has to be able to name them:

// ROUND 83 -- POPULATING IT.
//
//   "This should make for an acceptable sewer backdrop. Then populate."
//
// The backdrop is the two recoloured tiles. This is what stands on it.
//
// GENERATED FROM THE MAP, NOT SCATTERED AT RUNTIME. `SEWER_ROOM.props` is the
// same shape every other interior's prop list is -- `{ key, tx, ty }` -- so
// the props are drawn, depth-sorted, room-tagged and given collision by the
// pass that already does that for the smithy and the temple. Nothing new draws
// anything. What is new is only that this list is computed rather than typed,
// because 35 chambers of hand-placed furniture is not a table anyone would
// keep correct.
//
// WHAT EACH CHAMBER GETS, and why it differs:
//
//   * THE START is the ritual. The cult set up here and the player wakes in
//     what is left of it, so it gets the idol, the podium, the shrine niche
//     and the amphorae -- objects that say a ceremony happened, standing among
//     the bones the map already places.
//   * A ROUTE CHAMBER gets almost nothing: a barrel against a wall, a brazier.
//     The route has to stay READABLE. A player following the water is looking
//     for the next doorway, and clutter on the path is the one place clutter
//     costs something.
//   * A DEAD END gets the clutter instead -- crates, sacks, a handcart, a wash
//     tub -- because a dead end is where the loot is, and the reward for
//     turning off the route should look like somewhere worth having turned
//     off for. This is the same deal the maze itself makes, dressed.
//   * THE LAST CHAMBER is the ritual again, bigger and burning.
//
// AND NOTHING IS PLACED WHERE IT COULD BLOCK THE WAY. Props are solid: a
// barrel in a doorway is a maze that cannot be finished. So a prop tile must
// be next to a wall, must not be within two tiles of a chamber's wall line
// (which is where the doorways are), and must not already carry a mark. The
// fault checker then re-runs the reachability proof WITH the props treated as
// walls, so "the props did not seal anything" is checked rather than argued.
