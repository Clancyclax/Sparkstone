// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 51 -- LEVER CHARTERS: what an essence is allowed to REFUSE.
//
// The user, on the generated roster: "I'm not seeing enough separation between
// builds... I really want each build to feel somewhat unique instead of the
// same generic build with some flavor text."
//
// Measured before this file existed, over 1,200 generated abilities:
//
//   - `projectileBall` was 16.3% of everything. One ability in six.
//   - Two random 20-ability builds shared 41.7% of their template multiset,
//     and the most-alike pair shared 73.9%.
//   - Probing sixteen different stones against one essence, nearly every
//     candidate pool offered the same core five: bolt, ring, aura, perception,
//     triggered passive.
//   - Within 196 generated bolts there were 108 distinct `_leverRider` values
//     but only 11 distinct `base` damages and 5 distinct projectile speeds.
//     The variety was a garnish on an identical dish.
//
// The structural cause is that an essence could only ever REORDER one shared
// pool of categories. The bias list nudges what gets tried first; nothing
// could say "Renewal does not produce a plain damage bolt." So every essence,
// eventually, produced one.
//
// This file is that missing "no". Each of the nineteen levers gets a charter:
// the effect FAMILIES it may produce, and the families it may not. An essence
// inherits the union of its motif levers' charters, and a deny beats an allow.
// All 146 essences get a shape from this without a line of per-essence
// authoring -- the marquee jobs (round 51 phase 7) then narrow it further.
//
// Families are named at a coarser grain than templates on purpose. "Renewal
// may not deal direct damage" is a design statement; "Renewal may not use
// projectileBall" is an implementation detail that would need rewriting the
// first time a new damage template landed.
// ===========================================================================

  //   triggered_*      `trigger` plus what each one actually DOES -- the same
  //                    filing the round-75 stacking block uses, and for the
