// NPC atlas layout, ported from sparkstone_prototype.html lines ~8595-8636
// (SHOPKEEPER_CELL/GUILDMASTER_CELL/NPC_ART). Both are real extracted art:
// 512x64 PNGs, 8 direction-columns x 1 row, static (no animation frames at
// all -- confirmed against the original's own comment: "Static NPC, no
// animation needed").
//
// NEW round 3: 10 new humanoid NPCs (user-uploaded PixelLab art, same
// 512x64/8-column layout, extracted by extract_round3.py) plus a SOFT
// palette-variant system for every non-monster NPC -- the user's own words:
// "for all NPCs that are not monsters please [do] a very soft set of
// palette swaps to allow for more variety in NPC interaction." Each base
// NPC art key optionally has one or more `_v1`/`_v2` sibling atlases (built
// by the same extraction script, capped at a +-18deg hue shift and small
// sat/val nudges -- deliberately much gentler than the monster roster's
// bold recolors, so a variant reads as "the same person, slightly different
// coloring" rather than a different character). Every variant is registered
// as its own independent NPC_ART entry with the exact same footX/footY/
// scale as its base (they're pixel-identical recolors of the same source
// art, so the anchor never changes) -- callers just treat a variant artKey
// as an ordinary NPC art key like any other.

export const NPC_CELL = 64;

// Shared foot-anchor convention for every NPC in this file (base game +
// round 3): built with NPC_BASELINE_MARGIN=1 in extract_round3.py, i.e. the
// sprite's feet sit 1px up from the bottom of its 64px cell -- same anchor
// shopkeeper/guildmaster already used, so every new NPC (and every variant
// of every NPC) lines up on the ground the same way with zero per-entry
// tuning.

// ROUND 134 (item 4) -- AN NPC THAT WALKS.
//
// The user: "Cultist is not utilizing the movement animation. This was already
// uploaded, please ensure all character with movement animations have them
// active (and recolored as needed to match the static variant)"
//
// Until this round NO entry in this file had more than one frame per
// direction. Every `npc_*.png` is 8 x 64 -- one static pose per direction --
// so a cultist charging across a camp was that pose, translated. The four
// party members and the named cast have had walk cycles since round 46, but
// they live in CHAR_ART and read through `_drawPartyMember`; nothing on this
// side of the fence had a second state to be in.
//
// `walk` is that second state, and it is OPTIONAL: an entry without one is
// exactly what it was. It carries its own cell and its own foot because the
// delivery's running frames are 92px against the rotations' 64, and the two
// therefore need different origins -- `_npcWalkFrame` is the one place that
// arithmetic lives.
//
// ONLY THE MAN. The drop contains one model's running frames; the woman's
// static sheet has no animation to attach, so `npc_cultist_woman` and its ten
// recolours keep the single pose. Named here rather than left implicit,
// because "half the cult animates" is a fact about the art we have and not an
// oversight to be found later.

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 172 -- ELEVEN MORE WALK CYCLES.
//
// The user: "Also added walking animations for a number of the NPCs, color the
// new animations as needed to support the color work done previously. This
// should reduce (or eliminate) the number of NPCs that move around without
// moving their legs."
//
// Every number below was MEASURED by tools/sheet_round172_walks.py rather than
// typed: the cell is the largest frame in the delivery, the foot is where the
// south pose's lowest opaque pixel lands, and which character each delivery IS
// was decided by comparing its south rotation against every idle sheet in the
// game -- not by reading the folder name, which is the prompt that made it.
// Ten matched a character already in the roster at 1.000 against a best
// runner-up of 0.616. The eleventh matched nobody (0.475, flat) and came in as
// a new character with rotations of his own.
//
// The `_v1`/`_v2` walks are DERIVED, not delivered: the colour map is read off
// the pair of idle sheets and replayed onto the walk frames, so a recoloured
// person keeps their clothes the moment they start moving. Round 134's trick,
// reused.

// Measured, that gap was stark. Cadence has fourteen named townsfolk with
// written dialogue (buildNpcList above). Harrowmoor, Little Gale, Sailmend,
// Cobb Point, Karsk Landing and Vashra had, between all six of them, one
// generated shopkeeper each saying the same sentence.
//
// So: thirty-one named people across the six, placed by an offset from their
// own settlement's centre exactly the way the capital's fourteen are placed off
// townOrigin. Their lines do three jobs at once -- they say where you are, they
// say what that region is like, and (deliberately) they carry the STORY beats
// DESIGN_STORY.md has for that region, which until now existed only in the
// document: the Division gone underground in Ontaria, the portal specialist who
// will not appear below Gold in Elehyd, and Vashra's disappearances and its
// noble houses.
//
// This is rumour, not questline. Nothing here can be accepted, completed or
// failed; it is the world talking about things the player will later be able to
// do something about, which is what makes a questline feel like it was always
// coming rather than switched on.
// ============================================================================

// ART NOTE: `npc_noblewoman` is deliberately absent. Round 50 found that model
// is drawn without legs and asserts, to this day, that nothing in the world
// uses it -- which is exactly the assertion that caught four of these folk on
// their first run. `npc_posh_noble_girl` is the intact noble model.

  // measured. It did not measure the other fifteen. Counted this round:
  //
  //   settlements in the world ....................... 22
  //   with authored folk ............................. 6   (round 65)
  //   Cadence, whose fourteen come from buildNpcList .. 1
  //   with NOBODY ..................................... 15
  //
  // and of those fifteen, TEN are the three regions the surge has never
  // spoken to -- Sirukh Sands, the Cinderwaste and Ixcuatl, which between
  // them did not hold a single named person. Three whole countries in which
  // every human being said the one generated shopkeeper's sentence.
  //
  // Fourteen are populated below. THE FIFTEENTH IS DELIBERATE: the Stepped
  // City is `kind: 'ruin'` and its region's own blurb says nobody has lived
  // there in a long time, so putting three people in it to make a number
  // even would contradict the map. Its emptiness is asserted rather than
  // left to be read as an oversight -- see settlementFolkFaults below.
  //
  // Same rules as round 65: rumour, not questline; placed by an offset from
  // their own settlement's centre; and the lines carry that region's story
  // beat rather than describing the scenery the player is already standing
  // in. AND, new this round, they are inside the round-171 slop gate, which
  // had never been pointed at this file -- the largest pool of authored
