// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 206 -- THE STONE DECIDES HOW, AND THE KIT SAYS SO ON THE CARD.
//
// The user's model, in their own words:
//
//   "The essences determine the synergy the confluence determines the shape
//    and other effects."
//
// and, for what makes two identical essence sets play differently:
//
//   "If someone else ended up with the same confluence and 3 of the same
//    essences the build would be similar but not identical because of the
//    awakening stones."
//
// So there are three layers and each one has a job:
//
//   ESSENCE  -> the TOKENS. What you deal in.   (essenceTokens.js, round 206)
//   STONE    -> the VERB.   How you deal in it.  (this file)
//   CONFLUENCE -> the SHAPE. dps/tank/healer.    (buildClasses.js, round 190)
//
// The third has existed since round 190 and was always right about shape; it
// was only ever wrong as a hook for SYNERGY, which is what round 205b found
// on Arsenal. This file is the middle layer.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT A VERB IS.
//
// Six, from the user's own examples in the confluence discussion:
//
//   seed       an ability of one essence applies another's condition
//              -- "sword abilities that trigger bleed and fire"
//   detonate   a condition landing on a target that already carries another
//              -- "bonuses for freezing burning enemies"
//   alias      one condition counts as another for everything else's triggers
//              -- "make bleeding count as burning for the purpose of other
//                 abilities who do more damage to burning enemies"
//   transfer   a bonus to one thing also applies to another
//              -- "fire damage buffs affect cold damage"
//   alternate  rotating between two poles pays
//              -- "make rotating between sun and moon beneficial"
//   share      what one member grants, all members grant
//              -- round 205's Arsenal, already shipped
//
// ONLY `seed` IS WIRED IN THIS ROUND, and `WIRED` below says so rather than
// leaving it to be discovered. The other five are named here because the table
// that picks a verb has to be complete to be reviewable -- but a verb nothing
// reads is this project's fault class 2, so `synergyFaults` reports every
// unwired verb every time it runs. They cannot be quietly forgotten.
//
// Why `seed` first: it rides `spec.debuff`, which the runtime has applied at
// nine call sites since round 57, so it needs no new damage plumbing at all.
// `detonate` needs a per-ability-against-this-target multiplier threaded
// through about twenty damage sites, and `alias` is meaningless until
// `detonate` exists to read the tag -- shipping it first would be a field
// written by one side and read by none, again.

//
//   alias      needed something in the game to ask WHAT a target is
//              suffering. Round 207's gates only ever asked how MUCH. The
//              three condition gates added this round are that reader, so
//              alias writes an element onto the target and a gate reads it.
//   transfer   needed one seam where an element-scoped bonus is read. There
//              is exactly one: `_statBuff('dmg_<element>')`, wrapped once,
//              and every call site in the scene inherits it.
//   alternate  needed the player to remember what they cast last, and
//              nothing in the game tracked it. It does now, written at the
//              cooldown commit -- the one line every successful cast reaches
