// (specific to each magical damage type), block chance, dodge chance, HP
// recovery rate, stamina recovery rate, mana recovery rate, weapon attack
// speed, spell cast speed, cooldown reduction," with the MAJOR attributes
// (Power/Spirit/Speed/Recovery) each influencing a few minor stats
// thematically, and rarity-tiered items rolling minor-stat buffs.

// ROUND 58 -- FOUR TIMES THE IMPACT, and this comment is now COMPLETE.
//
// The user: "Because a character will get so few attribute points they should
// be more impactful, lets start with 4 times larger impact."
//
// Every coefficient below is 4x its round-10 value. The reason it works is the
// round-6 economy: a point is not something you buy, it is a bond plus a rank
// step plus the occasional passive, so a character runs 0-8 points in an
// attribute across a whole game. At the old rates one point of Spirit bought 4%
// cast speed, which is not a decision anybody feels.
//
// Two effects are NEW this round, both at the post-multiplier rate the user
// named rather than 4x some smaller number.
//
//   Power    -> max HP (+60/pt), crit damage (+0.20x/pt), block (+6%/pt),
//               ARMOUR (+1.6%/pt)
//   Speed    -> max Stamina (+48/pt), weapon attack speed (+16%/pt),
//               dodge (+6%/pt), MOVEMENT SPEED (+12%/pt)   [new, round 58]
//   Spirit   -> max Mana (+48/pt), spell cast speed (+16%/pt), crit chance
//               (+4%/pt), ALL elemental resistances (+8%/pt),
//               AURA RANGE (+12%/pt)                       [new, round 58]
//   Recovery -> HP recovery (+1% max/s per pt -- HP regen exists at all only
//               through Recovery, items and abilities), stamina recovery and
//               mana recovery (+2% max/s per pt on the 1.5%/s base)
//   (The user's own example held: Speed affects weapon attack speed, and
//   never HP recovery.)
//
// ARMOUR was missing from this list for thirty-one rounds. It was added to

// exists precisely to be the one place the major->minor map is written down --
// was never updated. Anything that is true of an attribute belongs HERE.

// Item rarity ladder -- SAME terminology as essence/awakening stones, with
// the classic color progression white/green/blue/purple/orange/red:
//   Common (white):    basic damage/speed only -- NO minor stat buffs
//   Uncommon (green):  1 minor stat buff at base magnitude
//   Rare (blue):       2 buffs, or 1 at +25%
//   Epic (purple):     3 buffs, or fewer at compounding +25% each step
//   Legendary (orange): 4 buffs, same trade
//   Divine (red):      5 buffs, same trade
// Formalized: a tier has `slots` buff slots; an item rolls n <= slots
// buffs, each at base * 1.25^(slots - n). Summoned relics (awakening.js)

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 74 (item 8) -- ITEM RANK AND ITEM LEVEL.
//
// The user:
//
//   "There should be an item rank and item level system for gear. You should
//    not be able to equip an item above your rank. An uncommon bronze rank
//    item should be better then a legendary iron rank item."
//
// Before this round an item was a rarity and nothing else. That gave the whole
// game ONE axis of gear progression with six notches on it, which is why a
// Legendary dropped in the first hour was still the best thing a Gold-rank
// character owned -- there was no way for the world to hand out better steel
// as you climbed, only rarer steel.
//
// TWO AXES NOW, and the user's sentence is what sets their relative weight:
//
//   RARITY  how well this particular piece rolled. Common..Divine, six
//           notches, +25% each. This is the axis that already existed and it
//           is unchanged -- it still decides how many buffs a piece carries.
//   RANK    what tier of the world it came from. Iron..Gold, and a rank is
//           worth GEAR_RANK_STEP of the rarity axis end to end.
//   LEVEL   0-9 within a rank, the same ten-step ladder essences climb, worth
//           up to +30% across the rank.
//
// GEAR_RANK_STEP = 2.2 is SOLVED from the user's sentence, not chosen. An
// Uncommon (1.25) at one rank up must beat a Legendary (2.0) at the rank
// below, so the step must exceed 2.0/1.25 = 1.6. At 2.2:
//
//   Legendary Iron 0 ....... 2.00      Uncommon Bronze 0 ...... 2.75   ✓
//   Legendary Iron 9 ....... 2.60      Uncommon Bronze 0 ...... 2.75   ✓
//   Divine Iron 9 .......... 2.93      Common Bronze 0 ........ 2.20
//
// -- so the rule the user stated holds even at the extreme ends of both
// ranks, while a PERFECT piece of the lower rank still edges out a poor piece
// of the higher one. That last property is deliberate: it means a Divine you
// found early stays worth carrying for a while rather than being obsoleted by
// the first grey drop of the next rank.
//
// No diamond, per the standing rule.

/**
 * ROUND 74 -- WHY THE COMPARISON SCALE AND THE STAT CURVE ARE TWO NUMBERS.
 *
 * `gearPower` above is the comparison scale and it is geometric, because the
 * user's sentence is about ranks being worth a lot. The STAT MAGNITUDES cannot
 * all follow it, and this is not a tuning preference -- it is arithmetic:
 *
 *   A flat stat has no ceiling. +8 max HP at Iron becoming +111 at Gold 9 is
 *   fine and is what an end-game piece should look like.
 *
 *   A PERCENTAGE stat lives in a bounded space with a cap (CAPS, below:
 *   armour 0.80, dodge 0.60, resist 0.75). A chest plate starts at 0.112
 *   armour -- already a seventh of the ceiling -- so multiplying it by 13.8
 *   does not make a better chest plate, it makes one chest plate that reaches
 *   the cap on its own and four other armour slots that do nothing. Measured:
 *   0.112 x 13.84 = 1.55, clamped to 0.80 by a single item.
 *
 * So flat stats take the full multiplier and capped ones take its CUBE ROOT,
 * which lands a Gold 9 chest at 0.269 -- more than twice an Iron piece, still
 * leaving every other slot something to contribute before the cap.
 *
 * AND INHERENT ARMOUR IS RANK-DRIVEN, NOT RARITY-DRIVEN. That is the other
 * half of making the user's sentence true rather than merely representable.
 * Rarity's job is how MANY buffs a piece rolled -- that is what RARITY_TIERS
 * `slots` has always meant. Letting it also multiply the armour by up to 2.2x
 * made a Legendary Iron breastplate genuinely tougher than an Uncommon Bronze
 * one whatever the ranks said, and no rank ladder that respects the cap can
 * out-multiply that. Rarity = how well it rolled; rank = how good the steel
 * is. The two axes now mean different things instead of both meaning "better".
 *
 * One honest limit, stated rather than hidden: a Legendary that rolls a SINGLE
 * buff gets `rollBuffs`'s concentration bonus (1.25^3 = 1.95x), so on that one
 * stat it can still edge an Uncommon of the next rank up. The user's rule is
 * enforced exactly where a player acts on it -- `gearPower`, the comparison on
 * the card, and the inherent armour every armour piece carries.
