// ROUND 67 -- SOUND.
//
// The engine has supported it since round 43 ("gets sound support as a side
// effect of switching engines") and the game has been silent for twenty-four
// rounds. Round 65's review listed it as the oldest open item in the project.
//
// The user supplied five music tracks and five ambiance beds, and is holding
// back "a large amount of spell and weapon sounds" until this exists. So the
// design goal is not "play the ten files we have" -- it is a bus architecture
// those hundreds of files can be poured into later without a second system.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FOUR BUSES, BECAUSE THE USER ASKED FOR FOUR SLIDERS
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   master     everything, multiplied into the other three
//   music      the scored tracks
//   ambiance   the environmental beds, which run UNDER the music
//   spells     ability and weapon sound effects
//
// Effective volume is always `master * bus`, so pulling master to zero is a
// real mute and no bus can escape it. Stored per-slider so a player who muted
// music and then turns master back up gets music still muted, which is what
// every mixer in every game does and what people expect.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MUSIC AND AMBIANCE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Music is chosen by CONTEXT -- what you are doing and where you are standing.
// Ambiance is chosen by PLACE and TIME -- what the world outside sounds like.
// They layer: Region 1's forest bed keeps running under the Region 1 theme,
// and when you step into a cave the music changes to something eerie while the
// bed drops away, because a cave does not have birdsong in it.
//
// Both crossfade rather than cut. A hard switch at a region boundary is the
// single most noticeable thing bad game audio does.
