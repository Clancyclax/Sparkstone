// Town/road/building generation, redesigned for this port's world size.
// Ported CONCEPTS from the original (sparkstone_prototype.html lines
// ~3258-3337 town-tile classification, ~3638-3720 buildingSpots generation,
// ~3298-3305 + ~6944-6954 building atlas layout) -- the ALGORITHM SHAPE is
// faithful (plaza disc + Manhattan avenue/street/alley grid + quadrant-lot
// building placement + a 4-column N/E/S/W building atlas), but every
// distance constant is rescaled down for this test map (the original's town
// alone is 1472px across on a 6144px map; this port's whole map is smaller
// than that). Ratios were NOT simply divided by a constant factor -- that
// would make streets sub-tile-width -- they were re-picked by hand to stay
// sensible at TILE=32 granularity while preserving the same structural
// relationships (plaza inside city inside wilderness, blocks wide enough to
// hold a building each).
//
// THE BUG THIS ROUND ACTUALLY FIXES: the original's `facingTowardRoad`
// finds which raw world-cardinal direction (N/S/E/W in plain world space)
// the nearest road tile is in, and feeds that directly into a 4-column
// building atlas with NO iso conversion -- which is wrong, because under
// this game's isometric projection a world-cardinal direction is NOT the
// same as a screen-cardinal direction (world +X renders as screen
// down-right, not screen-right). `findBuildingFacing` below does the same
// "which direction is the nearest road" search, but then runs that
// direction through the SAME iso-weighting `facingFromMove` uses for every
// other directional sprite in the game before picking a column.
//
// CORRECTION (this round): the Phase 3 fix above converted to a screen
// angle but then snapped it to the nearest of 4 SCREEN-CARDINAL directions
// (north/east/south/west on screen). That's still wrong, and provably so:
// this game's roads only ever run along the two world axes, and under this
// projection (isoProject: screen.x = wx - wy, screen.y = (wx+wy)/2) a
// world-axis-aligned road ALWAYS renders on screen at a slope of exactly
// +-1 in ISO_TW:ISO_TH-normalized space -- i.e. at a screen angle of
// +-26.57 deg or +-153.43 deg off horizontal, which is always closer to a
// 45 deg (diagonal) screen direction than a 90 deg (cardinal) one (since
// 26.57 < 45 - 18.43, the cardinal is always the *farther* of the two
// nearest snap targets). So a building facing "toward the road" can never
// legitimately read as facing screen-north/east/south/west here -- it
// should always land on screen-northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest.
// This matches what's visually obvious once you look at the town: the
// streets themselves only ever draw as diagonal lines on screen, never as
// vertical/horizontal ones, so a building "facing the street" has to face
// diagonally too.
//
// UPDATE (later this same round): the building atlas originally only had
// 4 columns per building (real front/back/side-left/side-right art, no
// true per-angle diagonal renders), which meant the fix above had to reuse
// those 4 columns and just relabel which screen angles mapped to which
// column. The user then re-uploaded every building pack with all 8 real
// rotations (see extract_town_buildings.py), so town_singletons.png/
// town_pool.png are now genuine 8-column atlases -- one real drawn frame
// per direction, no relabeling needed. `findBuildingFacing` below now
// calls the shared `facingFromMove` (iso.js) directly; it still only ever
// returns a diagonal in practice (see the math above), but that's a
// property of the road search, not a limitation of the art or the snap
// function anymore -- the north/east/south/west columns are real art too,
// just never selected by this particular search.

// (footprintHalfWidth / sqrt(2)) given this game's iso skew (isoProject's
// screen.x = wx - wy means a world-space circle of radius R becomes a
// screen ellipse with x half-width R*sqrt(2)) -- that math alone points at
// ~36-43 at the OLD 1.2 display scale. Landed on 34 (up from 24): most of
// the way there while staying safely under the lot-spacing ceiling derived
// above (2*34=68 world units between adjacent building centers, well under
// the 120px measured minimum spacing) and the per-lot street clearance
// margin (13-18px at radius 24 per the derivation above; a +10 radius bump
// eats some of that but never flips it negative for any lot). This directly
// fixes "collision is off" and, as a side effect, "roads don't line up with
// the entrance": with the old undersized circle, the invisible wall stopped
// you well short of the visible door/wall, in a spot that didn't look
// connected to the street it was supposedly facing -- one root cause, two
// symptoms, not two separate bugs.
// v3 (round 4): re-measured against the round-4 art at the new
// TOWN_DISPLAY_SCALE (see that constant's own comment for the full
// footprint-measurement derivation). The ask this round was explicit and
// geometric: "the houses should be able to fit very neatly onto the grid as
// a 5x5 or 4x5 [tile grid]." A world-space AXIS-ALIGNED SQUARE footprint of
// side L (world units) projects under this game's isoProject (screen.x =
// wx-wy, screen.y = (wx+wy)/2) to a screen DIAMOND of width 2L and height L
// -- NOT the circle-to-ellipse formula used for the v2 radius (that formula
// answers a different question, "how does a collision CIRCLE look on
// screen", not "how many tiles wide is this footprint"). Working backwards
// from the widest measured building footprint (~102px native at
// TOWN_CELL=150) so even the widest building stays inside a 5-tile
// (5*TILE=160 world unit) box: display scale (see below) is chosen so
// 102px * scale = 5-tile screen diamond width (2*160=320px) -> scale ~3.14.
// At that same scale the narrowest measured buildings (~86px native) render
// at ~270px screen width, i.e. ~4.2 tiles -- landing exactly in the user's
// named "4x5 or 5x5" range without any extra tuning. BUILDING_RADIUS is the
// (necessarily coarser) CIRCLE collision approximation of that same
// footprint: using a representative ~4.5-tile-wide footprint (L=144 world
// units), a circle inscribed in that square has radius L/2=72; landed on 76
// (a hair over the inscribed radius, safely under the L*sqrt(2)/2=~102
// circumscribed radius) so the invisible wall sits close to the visible
// wall on every side without ever reaching past a corner -- matches the
// ask's own "at least close to the boundary of the house" bar rather than
// promising pixel-exact wall collision (a circle can never exactly match a
// rectangular building footprint). Verify empirically via screenshot before

// Walk outward in each of the 4 WORLD-cardinal directions from a building
// position until a road tile is found; face toward whichever is closest.
// Same search shape as the original's facingTowardRoad, but the result then
// goes through facingFromMove (iso.js) instead of being used raw -- that's
// the actual, complete fix.
//
// Note this will still only ever land on a screen DIAGONAL
// (northeast/southeast/southwest/northwest), never a screen cardinal, even
// though facingFromMove can return all 8 -- that's not a restriction coded
// in here, it's a property of the search above always feeding in a pure
// world-axis vector (0,-1)/(0,1)/(1,0)/(-1,0): under this projection a
// world-axis-aligned direction always renders on screen at +-26.57deg or
// +-153.43deg off horizontal, which is always closer to a 45deg diagonal
// than a 0/90deg cardinal (26.57 > 45-26.57). So a building "facing toward
// the road" can never legitimately read as facing screen-north/east/south/
// west here -- the north/east/south/west columns of the atlas exist (real
// art, not filler) but simply never get selected by this particular
// search, the same way they wouldn't for a human artist reasoning about
// which way these buildings should face on this street grid.
// --- Wrought Iron Fence (NEW round 3): the user's own words -- "I also
// added a wrought iron fence with 8 directions to create yards and some
// interesting areas in the town." Same object-format PixelLab export as the

// extract_round3.py into fence.png, a 384x48 8-column atlas (one real drawn
// direction per PLAYER_DIR_ORDER column, cell=48), same convention as
// town_singletons.png/town_pool.png.

// the shared facingFromMove snapper instead of guessing a screen direction
// by hand. Because a world-axis vector under this iso projection always
// resolves to a screen DIAGONAL (see the giant header comment above), all
// four edges of a world-aligned rectangle each get one consistent diagonal
// facing -- north edge panels all face 'northeast', south edge panels all
// face 'southwest', etc -- which reads correctly on screen and needs no

// extract_round28_gardenfence.py. The display scale is what reconciles the
// two: the old fence drew 47px of content at 1.1 (about 52 on screen), the

// 1.118n px apart on screen. The diagonal rotations draw about 45px wide at
// the display scale above, so 48 units put the centres 54px apart and opened a
