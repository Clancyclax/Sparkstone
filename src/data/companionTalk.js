// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 211 -- THE COMPANIONS GET A TREE.
//
// The user, in the dialogue spec (2.3.3):
//
//   "Companions should have the largest dialogue trees with new options being
//    added at each new region and each milestone. They should talk about the
//    cities, regions, quests, each other, hopes, dreams, their essences, and
//    the world as a whole."
//
// WHAT WAS THERE. Round 76 gave each companion an ARC -- an ordered list of
// things they will tell you, one per conversation, gated on rank and region.
// That is still the best writing about who these people are and none of it is
// touched. But an arc is something they tell YOU; it has no questions in it.
// Press E on Zeke and you got the next confession and then a stat readout,
// and when the arc was spent you got an idle line and a stat readout forever.
//
// So the arc becomes the GREETING and this tree opens underneath it, exactly
// the way round 209 hung the standard tree under an important person's
// scripted page. The arc keeps the beats that have to land in order; the tree
// holds everything the player might want to ask about on any given day.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS NOT THE TOWNSFOLK TREE WITH MORE ROWS.
//
// dialogue.js answers a topic by picking from a pool of lines tagged with a
// VOICE, because there are six hundred townsfolk and no way to write six
// hundred people. There are FIVE companions. They are named, they have
// histories the user wrote, and the entire point of a companion is that you
// know which one is talking before you read the name.
//
// So every answer here is keyed by SPEAKER, not drawn from a pool, and the
// faults assert that no two companions ever give the same answer to the same
// question. A pool would have been less writing and would have produced five
// people who sound like one person with five hats, which is the round 210
// complaint arriving in a new file.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// "NEW OPTIONS AT EACH NEW REGION AND EACH MILESTONE."
//
// Three mechanisms, all data:
//
//   `when(ctx)` on a topic      -- the row does not appear until it is true
//   `byRegion[region][speaker]` -- the same row answers differently per place
//   `byAct[act][speaker]`       -- and differently as the story moves
//
// `c_here_now` is the region one and it is the heart of the ask: its LABEL is
// the region's own name, so walking into Bratugal with the twins in the party
// puts "Bratugal, then." on the list, and they have something to say about it
// that nobody else does. Seven regions by five speakers is thirty-five lines
// for one row, which is the price of the row meaning anything.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TELLS ARE IMPORTED, NOT RE-DERIVED.
//
// Round 210 measured 34% of the townsfolk lines tripping an AI tell and put a
// ceiling on it. A brand new file of a hundred and fifty lines is exactly
// where that ceiling stops being enforced and the habit comes back, so
// `companionTalkFaults` runs round 210's own TELLS over every line in here.
// That is also the only real proof the guard was worth writing: it has to
// catch the thing written AFTER it, not the thing it was written about.
