// WHY THERE IS NO FIFTH CHAIR AND NO SIXTH TABLE. He asked for "4 or 5
// versions of each" and sent two chairs and two tables. The versions are
// PALETTES, not models -- which is what he asked for and is also the only
// answer that scales: five styles over eleven models is fifty-five looks out
// of one 448x1232 sheet, built one canvas at a time as a room asks for one.
//
// AND THE STYLE BELONGS TO THE BUILDING, NOT TO THE CHAIR. That is item 2.1,
// and it is the whole reason `styleForDwelling` takes a building rather than
// a tile: hashing per object would give a tavern five different chairs at one
// table, which is the thing he asked not to happen. Hashed rather than
// stored, so a dwelling has the same furniture every time it is walked into
// and across a save.
//
// THE SCALE IS DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN. Every model carries `tiles` -- how much
// floor it stands on, the same number round 23's prop table has carried since
// it was written -- and the draw scale falls out of that and the ink width
// the packer measured. Nobody picks a number that looks right; a table that
// covers a tile and a half covers a tile and a half.

// pixels, so a two-tile step puts the next counter 64 pixels along -- and the

// last. The number that makes them abut is not a count of tiles at all: it is
// `drawn width / 32`, and for this art that is three and a half.
