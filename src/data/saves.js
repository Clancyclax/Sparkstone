// ============================================================================
// ROUND 60 -- SAVING AND LOADING.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT ON: save the INPUTS, rebuild the DERIVED.
//
// A kit's twenty abilities are a pure function of its three essences, four
// stones per slot and four bound attributes (rebuildKnownAbilities). Writing
// those twenty generated abilities into the save file would freeze them at the
// version that wrote it -- and this project has changed the generator in
// nineteen of the last twenty rounds. Round 59 alone re-derived every summon's
// damage. A save from round 58 would then load abilities that no longer match
// their own numbers, and nothing would report it.
//
// So a save stores the essences, the stones, the attributes and the progress,
// and the abilities are regenerated on load. A save written today still opens
// on a build a year from now, and opens with that build's abilities.
//
// What IS stored verbatim is everything that cannot be recomputed: where the
// player stands, what they are carrying, what they have killed, which gods
// they have offended, what the bounty board is offering.
// ============================================================================

// ROUND 74 (item 7) -- the save list shows the player's standing, and it comes
// from the same two functions the HUD uses rather than from a fourth copy of a
// level curve. See essenceRank.js's playerStandingFrom.
import { playerStandingFrom, formatStanding } from './essenceRank.js';
// ROUND 76 -- the god keys `player.divineGod` is drawn from. See blocker 2 in
// sanitiseSlots: this used to be checked against the essence catalogue.

// ROUND 75 -- SETS AND MAPS SURVIVE THE FILE.
//
// `plain()` walked a Set the same way it walks any object: no own enumerable
// properties, so a Set came out as `{}` and went into the file as `{}`. Three
// player fields are collections --
//
//     ownedWeapons    Set    every weapon the player has bought or been given
//     seenMonsters    Set    the bestiary
//     conjuredWeapons Map    relic weapons -> the ability that conjured them
//
// -- so loading a save handed the player an empty object in place of each.
// `p.ownedWeapons.has(...)` then throws, and so does the spread in
// `_reconcileConjuredItems`, which is where it finally surfaced: loading a
// save twice in one session crashed with "p.conjuredWeapons is not iterable".
//
// The quiet half is worse than the crash. A player who loads a save has, as
// far as `ownedWeapons` is concerned, bought nothing -- every weapon they own
// is gone, and the bestiary with it.
//
// Encoded with an explicit tag rather than as a bare array, because a bare
// array is ambiguous on the way back in (`inventory.essences` is genuinely an
// array of ids and must stay one) and because the tag makes an old file
// distinguishable from a new one, which the reviver below needs.
