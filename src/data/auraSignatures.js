// ============================================================================
// ROUND 122 -- THE AURA IS A REFLECTION OF THE BEARER.
//
// The user:
//
//   "Aura's are in many ways meant to be a reflection of the player so having
//    the Aura always have some unique aspect tied to the players essence or
//    confluence via a unique feature is a positive."
//
// and, on where the variety comes from:
//
//   "not every aura needs a debuff, but every aura should have a relevant,
//    thematic, ability and the debuff library provides a lot of that as well
//    as the type of variety I'm looking for."
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. Measured before this round: 0 of 122 generated aura
// abilities carried any mark of the essence that made them, and 122 of 122
// took the aura table's own colour. Two players with nothing in common who
// rolled Emberfield had, in every respect the game could see, the same
// ability. The aura -- the one power the setting treats as a person's
// signature -- was the least personal thing in the kit.
//
// THE SPLIT THIS FILE MAKES. An aura now has two authors:
//
//   the TABLE   gives the FIELD its character. Emberfield burns, Rimefield
//               stiffens, Tarpit drags. 44 of them, five rungs apiece, and
//               unchanged by this file.
//   the BEARER  gives it a SIGNATURE -- one feature that is theirs, drawn
//               from their essence's own levers and its own element, and
//               carried onto whichever field they happened to roll.
//
// So a Venom adept's Emberfield is a fire that festers, and a Swift adept's
// Emberfield is a fire nobody outruns, and neither is the other.
//
// PROCEDURAL FLOOR, AUTHORED CEILING -- the user's own choice when asked.
//
//   the floor    every one of the 148 essences has core levers (measured: all
//                148, no exceptions) and a family element, so LEVER_FEATURE
//                below covers the whole catalogue with 21 entries rather than
//                148. Nothing is ever blank.
//   the ceiling  AUTHORED overrides it for the confluences worth writing by
//                hand -- the ones the books actually name.
//
// The mechanical vocabulary is deliberately the one that already exists: every
// feature's `spec` is aura FIELDS the runtime already reads (round 115's 42,
// plus round 121's brand and round 122's condition), so a signature is a thing
// the game can already do, applied because of who you are. No new runtime.

 * ROUND 123 -- MEASURED, AND MOVED. The first cut of this drew from
 * `thematicDebuffsFor(the essence's channel)`, and across 300 generated auras
 * that produced **[Bleeding] on 52% of them**. The cause is structural rather
 * than unlucky: most essence families resolve to the `physical` channel, and
 * `physical` has exactly one affliction in the 33-entry table. So the one
 * feature whose whole job was to be personal was the same on half the
 * catalogue -- which is the opposite of the ask.
 *
 * The fix is to stop asking the six-channel table and start asking the
 * AFFLICTION POOLS, which exist for precisely this and which the user pointed
 * at by name: 1,088 named afflictions in 247 pools, one pool per essence (146
 * of the 148) and one per confluence (all 101), 27-35 entries each. A Venom
 * adept leaves [Blackened Veins]; an Echo adept leaves [The Returning Note].
 * Both resolve through `conditionDef` and apply through the same door as any
 * other condition, because round 113 registered them.
 *
 * Same-family essences share most of a pool (measured: Cat and Fox overlap 28
 * of 28), which is correct -- they ARE the same family -- and the seed still
 * usually separates them, because it picks a different member of the 28.
 *
 * Falls back to the channel table for the two essences with no pool (Gun,
 * Technology) rather than returning nothing: a signature with no mark is still
 * a signature, but a blank one would be the thing this round is fixing.
