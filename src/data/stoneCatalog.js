// ROUND 9 -- the FULL awakening stone catalog: every one of the 180 stones
// from the user's HWFWM_TTRPG.xlsx "Awakening Stones" sheet (names and
// rarities verbatim), each with an authored description in the established
// voice, a thematic FAMILY (drives ability-generation bias and DoT flavor
// -- see awakening.js's FAMILY_TRAITS), a theme color, and a flavor phrase
// woven into generated ability descriptions.
//
// The `family` taxonomy is what makes "a variety of abilities per essence
// and awakening stone combination" real: a Wolf stone leans bonded-summon
// and hunt-senses, a Shield stone leans conjured armor, a Venom stone
// leans lingering-poison bolts, a Dimension stone leans blinks -- 28
// families total, each with its own category bias.
//
// Sprites: 12 stones have hand-picked gem art (itemArt.js STONE_SPRITES);
// every other stone falls back to a deterministic hash into the restored
// 61-gem pool -- the prototype's own drawExtraGemIcon technique -- until
// the next sprite upload adds coverage.

  // follow its essence: "Awakening stones can share names." So the rule (no
  // confluence may also be a regular essence) is about ESSENCES, and the stone
  // catalogue is a separate keyspace that may name a concept the confluence
  // list also names -- a Stone of Wrath is not the Wrath confluence, and five
  // other stones (Karmic, Sky, Undeath, Vision, Wrath) have always done this.

  //
  // `potionCd` is the fraction each one takes off the 60-second potion
  // cooldown, and it is READ -- see POTION_CD_PER_STONE and
  // `_recomputeDerivedStats` in WorldScene. It is on the stone rather than
  // derived from the family so the four can differ: a Catalyst is about speed
  // and takes more off than an Antidote, which is about what is in the bottle.
  // They stack, and the total is capped, so a full rack of them is a build
  // rather than an exploit.

// ROUND 65 -- THE GODS' OWN STONES.
//
// Eight Divine-rarity stones, one per god, paid by the region-1 chapter of that
// god's DISCIPLE chain. They join the catalogue rather than living in a
// parallel list, so a god stone sockets, generates abilities, draws its icon
// and reads its tooltip through exactly the same code as the other 180 -- the
// alternative was a second stone system that would have had to be taught to
// every one of those places separately.
//
// What they must NOT do is turn up anywhere else. `godOnly` marks them, and
// the three places a stone can otherwise reach a player -- the monster drop
// table, a shop shelf, and a landmark's find -- all filter on it. A stone the
// god gives you personally, that a spider could also drop, is not a reward.
