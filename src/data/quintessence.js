// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 86 ITEM 3 -- QUINTESSENCE, NAMED FOR ESSENCES.
//
//   "Quintessence is derived from the element of the monster being fought but
//    it should still be named using the essence names. i.e. there is no ember
//    or bloom essence, but there is a fire essence and a plant essence meaning
//    it should be fire quintessence and plant quintessence. This also makes
//    for rarer quintessence as the rarity of the essence maps to the rarity of
//    the quintessence."
//
// WHAT ROUND 85 GOT WRONG. It invented a vocabulary -- Ember, Rime, Bloom,
// Dawn -- and a rank ladder of its own, Dim through Perfect. Both were
// parallel systems: the game already has a hundred and forty-eight essences
// with names and rarities, and a "Bright Bloom Mote" told the player nothing
// about anything else in the game. Nothing in a build should have its own
// private taxonomy for a thing the build already names.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOW. A quintessence IS an essence's raw material, so it takes the
// essence's name and the essence's rarity, and its price comes off the same
// rarity ladder every stone and essence in the game is priced from. "Fire
// Quintessence" is common because Fire is a common essence; "Dimension
// Quintessence" is legendary because Dimension is.
//
// WHERE THE RANK WENT. Round 85 put the monster's rank in the id, which is
// what produced thirty-five rows. Rank drives QUANTITY and the odds of the
// rare drop instead:
//
//   "If a creature drops 20 plant quintessence it might drop a little growth
//    quintessence"
//
// -- so a dragon is still worth more than a rat, without a second axis in the
// name. One id per essence, and the bag reads as a list of materials.
//
// THE SECOND TABLE is the interesting half. Every element has one obvious
// common drop and a short list of rarer, related ones, each with its own
// chance: fire gives Fire and sometimes Smoke and rarely Sun. That is what
// makes an element worth farming for something other than volume.
// ===========================================================================
