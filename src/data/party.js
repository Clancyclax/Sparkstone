// ROUND 44 -- THE PLAYER'S TEAM.
//
// The user's brief, verbatim: "the player will become part of a team and thus
// a group of NPCs will often be following the player each with their own
// essences and abilities... These NPCs will roughly align their rank to the
// player randomly around 10% ahead of or behind the players exact rank
// status. When entering town they may ask for a moment to meditate if they
// need to rank up."
//
// Four named members, each recruited in a stated region:
//   1) Zeke Clark          Healer      older human man, former farmer   Region 1
//   2) Encykla Britanika   Ranged DPS  older twin, elf                  Region 2
//   3) Ædia Britanika      Melee DPS   younger twin, elf                Region 2
//   4) Benjamin Iskarys    Tank        younger male Celestine           Region 2
//
// ROUND 46 -- THE REAL MODELS LANDED. `art` now names a key in
// characterManifest.js (CHAR_ART) rather than an npcs.js placeholder, and each
// member has an idle, a walk and an attack -- for the casters, the attack is
// the spell-casting animation. That was the one field the round-44 note said
// would need changing, and it was.

// ROUND 49 -- THE TEAM'S REAL ESSENCES.
//
// The user wrote the team's backgrounds and fixed each member's essences by
// hand, over several messages:
//
//   "Zeke (Healer) with a Renewal, Prosperity, and Chicken" -- then, on being
//   told Prosperity is a confluence name and not a droppable essence:
//   "Instead lets give zeke, Renewal, Life, Chicken"
//
//   "Aedia (Melee DPS) has the Knife, Adept, and Foot"
//
//   "Encykla(Ranged DPS) has a Lightning, Fire, and Potent" -- then, on the
//   confluence that produced: "vortex keys off of Wind, water, void,
//   dimension... Lets switch her to Lightning, Wind, and Vast which shoukd
//   result in the Storm Confluence."
//
//   "Benjamin (Tank) has the Might, Iron, and Blood" -- then "Lets swap might
//   for shield", then "Swap Benjamins Blood essence for the Pangolin essence."
//
// The confluences these resolve to, through round 49's lever-themed +
// keyword-ranked resolveConfluenceName:
//
//   Zeke     Renewal + Life + Chicken     heal   -> Confluence of Unity
//   Aedia    Knife + Adept + Foot         strike -> Confluence of Master
//   Encykla  Lightning + Wind + Vast      aoe    -> Confluence of Storm
//   Benjamin Shield + Iron + Pangolin     guard  -> Confluence of Fortress
//
// ROUND 49 -- TWO STONES PER SLOT, AND THE OTHER TWO ARE THE PLAYER'S.
//
// The user: "for the companion characters they should have their 4 essences (3
// regular and the confluemce) when each is met. lets populate 2 thematically
// appropriate awakening stones in each essence for the companions, and leave
// the remaining stones up to the player to provide the flexibilty and fun of
// essence building."
//
// So `stones` -- a flat list of four, which the kit generator spread across
// whichever essence it happened to be on -- becomes `slotStones`, the SAME
// four-list shape the player's own sockets use. Each slot arrives holding two
// of a STONE_SLOT_CAP of four, so every companion walks in half-built and the
// other half is a decision.
//
// The fourth list is the CONFLUENCE slot. A companion always has one, because
// they always have three essences, so it is stocked like the others rather than
// left empty -- an empty confluence would be the one slot that felt like a bug.
//
// The stone lists moved with them. Round 48 split the two catalogs -- essence
// is the LEVER, stone is the MATERIAL -- so a member's stones are no longer
// required to mirror their essences, but a tank carrying water stones would
// still read as an accident rather than a build.

// Each member's build, in the same shape GUARD_BUILDS uses, so the kit comes
// out of the SAME buildCandidatePool generator the watch and the player use.
// A healer really does get healing abilities, a tank really does get guard
// essences -- the role is the essence list, not a label on top of one.

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 133 -- RECRUITMENT IS A CONVERSATION NOW.
//
// The user:
//
//   "recruiting companions should involve seeing the exclamation point,
//    talking to them, learning a little bit of their story, and then agreeing
//    to help them out. Then they decide to join the team. It's currently too
//    fast to feel authentic."
//
// It was faster than that even: THREE lines of code joined a companion, and
// one of them did it without the player pressing anything. Walking within
// PARTY_RECRUIT_RANGE recruited on proximity, and the talk-to branch called
// `_recruitPartyMember` BEFORE it opened the dialogue -- so the greeting a
// companion gave you was said by somebody already on your team.
//
// `story` is what the ask calls "learning a little bit of their story": three
// or four pages, each one a beat, ending with them asking for something. The
// scene walks them one press at a time and only offers the accept on the last
// page, so the player agrees to a person rather than to a proximity check.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE. The alternative is a dialogue table keyed by member id in
// WorldScene, which is a second roster that can stop covering this one -- the
// fault class this project has written down half a dozen times. A companion
// with no `story` simply falls back to the old greeting, so the roster can
// grow without this file being the thing that breaks.
//
// Zeke is deliberately WITHOUT one. He already has the longest recruitment in
// the game -- an offer, a job out in the bottoms, a nag and a completion line
// -- and layering three pages of backstory in front of "I can't clear it
// alone" would be telling the player twice. His gate is a JOB; theirs is a
// conversation.
