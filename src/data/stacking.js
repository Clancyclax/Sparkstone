// ROUND 75 -- STACKING INSTANCES THAT ACCUMULATE AND ARE CONSUMED.
//
// The user, with the buff/debuff symbol drop:
//
//   "rare build-defining buffs/debuffs with stacking instances that
//    accumulate and are consumed"
//
// and three examples from the books: Sophie's Blessing of Anticipation,
// Jason's Sin / Mark of Sin, and Sophie's Agent of Karma.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT THE DEBUFF ENGINE. debuffs.js already stacks -- poison runs
// five deep, `stackCap` and `debuffMagnitude` have existed since round 57. But
// those stacks are a MAGNITUDE on a timer: they land, they make a number
// bigger for a while, and they expire having done what they were always going
// to do. Nothing spends them, and nothing about them changes what you do next.
//
// These are a RESOURCE. They build from one thing you do and are paid out on
// another, and the whole texture is the gap between: a player carrying eight
// stacks of Sin is holding something, and choosing when to spend it is the
// decision the mechanic exists to create. That is what "accumulate and are
// consumed" means and it is why this is a separate system rather than another
// row in DEBUFFS.
//
// THE THREE SHAPES, which are the user's three examples generalised:
//
//   BOON    builds on YOU from what you do, spent to empower what you do next.
//           Sophie's Blessing of Anticipation: preparation banked, then used.
//   MARK    builds on an ENEMY from your hits, detonated on them for damage
//           proportional to how much you put there. Jason's Mark of Sin.
//   LEDGER  builds on you from what is done TO you, and pays back out.
//           Sophie's Agent of Karma: harm accrues, and is answered.
//
// Every generated stacking effect is one of these three. The three authored
// signatures below are the book versions; the generator rolls the rest from
// the same parts, which is what the user asked for when they chose "a
// generated rare family" with the named ones as signatures inside it.
//
// DECAY IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS THE BALANCE. A resource that only ever goes up
// is a resource you open every fight at maximum, which is the same as not
// having one. Every effect below bleeds a stack every few seconds once you
// stop feeding it, so the stacks mean "what I have been doing lately" rather
// than "how long this character has existed".
