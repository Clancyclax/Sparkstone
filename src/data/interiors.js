// ROUND 22 -- INTERIOR SPACES.
//
// The user's ask: "Is it possible to create interior spaces for the houses,
// auction house, and/or blacksmith?" -- scoped (via their answer) to the
// BLACKSMITH, the AUCTION HOUSE and the GUILD HALL, with the user supplying
// the interior art.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE ROOMS LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD MAP, NOT A SEPARATE PHASER SCENE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The obvious instinct is one Phaser Scene per interior. That would be the
// wrong call for THIS codebase, and expensively so: WorldScene is a ~4,600
// line single scene that owns literally everything -- the player entity and
// its world position, the whole DOM UI layer (inventory, essences, hotbar,
// shop, dialogue, quest board, minimap), ability cooldowns, projectiles,
// pickups, floating combat text, collision, and the occlusion-fade
// registry. A second scene inherits none of it; every one of those systems
// would need either duplicating or hoisting into a shared registry, which
// is a multi-round refactor with a large regression surface across the
// essence/awakening architecture the user has explicitly told us not to
// disturb.
//
// So instead: an interior is a WALLED ROOM built out of ordinary world
// tiles, standing in a reserved district out in a far corner of the
// existing 390x390 map, and a door is a TELEPORT between the building's
// exterior doorstep and the room's entry pad. The player never leaves
// WorldScene, so every system above keeps working inside a room for free --
// you can open your inventory, swap essences, drink a potion, take a swing,
// and have a shop conversation indoors on day one, with no new code.
//
// This is not a hack; it is how a great many 2D RPGs actually ship
// interiors (the "interior map region" pattern), and it is chosen here for
// the concrete reason above rather than out of convenience.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHERE THE ROOMS SIT, AND WHY THEY ARE IN THREE DIFFERENT CORNERS
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The map is 390 tiles (12,480 world units) square with the town at its
// centre (6240, 6240). Everything the world generates is placed by RADIUS
// from that centre:
//
//   * classifyTile   -- plaza/streets only inside CITY_RADIUS (1950)
//   * generateForest -- trees out to mapHalf - 250      = 5,990
//   * generateRocks  -- rocks out to mapHalf - 200      = 6,040
//   * buildSpawnSample -- monsters out to CITY_RADIUS + 4100 = 6,050
//
// So any spot more than ~6,050 units from town centre is untouched by every
// outdoor system at once, and the map's corners are ~8,800 units out. Each
// room therefore gets its OWN corner -- north-west, north-east, south-west --
// with the nearest point of each room's reserved area sitting 6,640-7,170
// units from town centre, clear of the furthest of those four radii.
//
// Three corners rather than one shared district, because of a problem the
// first version of this actually had and testing caught: at zoom 1.6 the
// camera sees roughly 984 x 759 screen px, an isometric room 18 tiles across
// is about 1,024 px wide on screen, and three rooms packed into one 1,600
// unit district were therefore all VISIBLE AT ONCE -- standing at the anvil
// you could see the auction house and the guild hall floating in the
// distance. Ten thousand units apart, no two rooms can ever share a frame.
//
// Around each room, VOID_MARGIN_TILES of dead black floor (TILE_VOID) is
// stamped over the ordinary map. That ring is deliberately SMALL, because it
// is not what hides the outdoors: WorldScene simply does not draw a ground
// tile that is not an interior tile while the player is inside a room, and
// paints the camera's own background the same void colour, so the frame
// beyond the walls is uniformly dark however far the camera can see. Sizing
// the ring to cover the whole viewport instead was the first attempt and it
// does not fit -- the auction house's corner of the map is not wide enough to
// hold the ~27 tiles of margin that would need, and pushing the room inward
// to make room drags its exclusion zone back inside the radius where trees
// and rocks generate, which would leave a bald void-coloured patch of
// wilderness visible from outside. The ring's real job is just to keep
// generation clear of the walls.
//
// WorldScene applies an explicit exclusion rule anyway (see
// `insideInteriorDistrict`, used by _buildForest/_buildObstacles), because a
// silent dependency on four unrelated tuning constants staying where they
// are is exactly the kind of thing that breaks three rounds later.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// PLACEHOLDER ART
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The user is generating the interior art. Everything here is therefore
// built against a NAMED ART CONTRACT (floor key, wall key, prop key) that
// WorldScene resolves to real textures when they exist and to generated,
// clearly-labelled placeholders when they don't -- so the art landing is a
// drop-in, not a rebuild. See ROUND22_INTERIOR_ART_SPEC.md.

//
// THE COUNT IS THE DESIGN PROBLEM. There are ~350 non-wall buildings in the
// world plus Cadence's forty houses and the caves, and the obvious reading --
// one reserved room per building -- does not survive contact with either
// constraint this system has:
//
//   * SPACE. A room is 11x9 tiles plus a void margin and a gutter. Four
//     hundred of them do not fit in the reserved band without widening it into
//     ground the region generators use.
//   * THE DISPLAY LIST. Round 43 hit Phaser's 4,000-child cap and round 64 hit
//     it again at 4,096 with thirty-six den rooms, which is why dens build
//     their contents on first door open. Four hundred standing rooms is not a
//     near miss, it is an order of magnitude.
//
// THE OBSERVATION THAT DISSOLVES BOTH: the player can only be inside one
// building at a time. A room does not need to persist while nobody is in it --
// it needs to be the RIGHT room the moment somebody opens a door.
//
// So there is a small POOL of physical rooms, and entering an ordinary
// building dresses one of them for that building and sends you in. Which
// layout you get is a pure function of the building's own position, so the
// cottage on the north road is the same cottage every time you visit it, and
// the world is not storing four hundred rooms to promise you that.
//
// The pool is four rather than one purely for headroom: a door left standing
// open behind the player, a companion still walking out, a test that enters
// two buildings in the same frame. Nothing needs the fourth; it costs nothing.

// in Cadence. Three systems were stranded behind that one door:
//
//   * THE RANK LADDER -- five ranks, fifteen contracts, forty-eight steps --
//     is reported to the Guildmaster and the guild clerk, so a player in
//     Ontaria, Elehyd or Bratugal had to walk back to The Nek to advance a
//     star. Three acts of the game with no Society counter in them.
//   * THE MEMBER'S DISCOUNT, which is the reward a first-star contract offers
//     most often, is honoured at `SOCIETY_SHOP_ID` and nowhere else. Outside
//     The Nek it was a bonus that could be earned and never spent.
//   * ROUND 96'S WITHHELD CREDIT -- the Society declining to extend credit to
//     an adventurer whose judgement it does not trust -- is a consequence you
//     could only observe in Act 1.
//
// The crafters were the same story: all three benches, and the seventy-two
// authored confluence lines round 95.2 wrote for them, were in two Cadence
// interiors.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS NINE CLONES AND NOT NINE NEW ROOMS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The three interiors this needs ALREADY EXIST and are the right shape:
//
//   the smithy       -- blacksmith bench, armoursmith bench, a weapon counter
//   the auction house -- the auctioneer, a ledger clerk, the jewelcrafter
//   the guild hall    -- the Society clerk and a ranking adventurer
//
// which is exactly the Society Hall / Crafting Hall / Auction House the user
// named. So the geometry, the floors, the twenty-six props and the door
// spans are cloned from Cadence's and only the ADDRESS and the STAFF change.
// Nine hand-laid rooms would be nine chances to get a prop inside a wall, and
// the layouts are already the ones the round-50 doorstep fixes were measured
// against.
//
// The staff are new people with their own names and their own greeting lines,
// because a bench is a person (round 90's rule) and three Hessa Coalwrights
// standing in three cities is one Hessa Coalwright with a teleporter. What is
// NOT duplicated is the confluence insight: `crafterTalk.js` is keyed on the
// TRADE, so a Karsk armoursmith gives the armoursmith's reading of your
// confluence on the day she opens, with no new authoring at all. That is the
// whole reason round 95.2 keyed it that way.
