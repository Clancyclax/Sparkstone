// ============================================================================
// ROUND 108 -- THE COMPOSER.
//
// The user's formula, from the round-105 commission:
//
//   ability = type (special attack | spell)
//           x effect count
//           x effects
//           x modifiers
//           x damage types
//
// and the point of it, in their words: "the provided actions all need to be
// viable, and the ability generation should take a look at all the interesting
// different ways these can be mixed."
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES AND WHY THE COUNT FALLS SO FAR. There are 94 ability
// categories today and 56 templates. Most of a category is not a mechanic, it
// is an ATOM WELDED TO A DELIVERY AND AN ELEMENT: `ranged_dot`, `aoe_dot_ring`
// and `barrier_burn` are all `dot` with three different deliveries, and the
// only reason they are three rows is that nothing could say "dot, delivered as
// a ring". Eighteen atoms x six deliveries x twenty-eight damage types is a
// larger space than 94 rows, expressed in less.
//
// AND WHY IT IS NOT A FREE-FOR-ALL. Nothing here rolls uniformly. Every choice
// is GATED by the essence's levers -- which atoms it may use, which modifiers
// it may attach, how far it reaches -- so a composed ability is still a
// statement about the build that produced it. The lever system survives; this
// is what it was for. A composer that could give any essence any ability would
// undo round 51 and every round since.
//
// THIS FILE IS DATA AND ARITHMETIC ONLY. It emits a SPEC; it does not know how
// to draw or execute one. The runtime half is `_castComposed` in WorldScene,
// which walks `spec.effects` in order.

// runtime reads it in `_recomputeDerivedStats` -- so the active model (atoms
// combined into an ordered effect list) does not describe passives at all.
// They needed their own vocabulary, and this is it.
//
// WHAT DECIDED THE SHAPE. Not invention: the twenty passive templates the game
// already runs were classified by HOW each one reaches the player, and the
// classes fell out as sixteen. Every atom below names the template it emits
// onto, which is the point -- the passive runtime is not being replaced, only
// the 35-row table that used to choose from it. A passive atom that emitted
// onto no template would be a description of a passive rather than a passive.
//
// `slots` is how many distinct parameterisations the atom can produce, and it
// is what makes this a vocabulary rather than a renamed list: `stat` covers
// four categories, `conjure` three, `sense` six, because in each case the old
// rows differed only by a field value.

  // is. That was right and it had a hole underneath it: nothing gated the
  // effects at CAST time, so an iron-rank player pressed a gold-rank ability
  // and every one of its effects fired. The user read the result -- "as these
  // are iron rank abilities I think I'm seeing too many effects".
  //
  // So every effect carries the rank it becomes live at. The LEAD is always
  // iron, because the lead is what the ability IS; the rest arrive one rank at
  // a time, and everything past the third waits for gold. A low roll pulls the
  // first rider forward to iron, which is the "iron can still have 3 abilities
  // rarely" the user asked for -- rarely, and never more than three.
  // 1 effect at iron normally, 2 one time in three, 3 one time in six -- which
  // is the "rarely" in the user's sentence, stated as odds rather than as an
  // adverb so it can be measured (tools/probe_round112_ranks.mjs).

  // ZERO special attacks in twenty abilities.
  //
  // Two chances at melee rather than one, when the socket has a weapon and the
  // ability is hostile. Not forced -- a sword essence that could only ever
  // swing would lose the reach and the fire it also has, and the user's
  // complaint is that the kit does not LEAN into the weapon, not that it
  // should be nothing else.
  // Gated on the LEAD being hostile rather than on any effect being hostile:
  // the prerequisite downstream keys on the lead (a restore with an impact
  // riding on it is a restore), so biasing on the wider test just produced
  // melee deliveries that could never become special attacks. Three times in
  // four -- measured at two in three, which left a weapon build at 0.80
  // special attacks per kit against the "lean into it" the user asked for.

  // Staff and the rest supply no melee delivery at all, so a bow build could
  // not compose a special attack however hard it was biased, and weapon builds
