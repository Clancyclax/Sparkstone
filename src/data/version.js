// ROUND 42 -- the build stamp.
//
// The user asked for "a small unobtrusive 'Playing version Number X'" under
// the map, and the reason it earns its place is bigger than tidiness: three
// consecutive update packs sat unapplied on the Desktop without anyone being
// able to tell, because a running build says nothing about which round it
// is. Now it does -- one glance under the minimap answers "did the update
// land?" before any bug report is written.
//
// GAME_VERSION is the ROUND number, which is the unit this project has
// actually been developed and delivered in. Bump it in the same commit that
// ships a round; nothing else reads it.
// ROUND 104 -- BUMPED TO 104, AND ROUND 103's BUMP NEVER HAPPENED.
//
// The user, after the rebuild got past its earlier stop:
//
//   "STOPPED the version stamp reads '102' but round 103 was expected."
//
// The guard was right and the build was wrong. Round 103 shipped eleven part
// zips and a patch, and not one of them changed this line -- so the r103
// bundle genuinely contained a game that called itself 102, and the last line
// of defence was the only thing that noticed. Exactly what the comment three
// lines up asks for ("bump it in the same commit that ships a round"), and
// exactly what a comment cannot enforce.
//
// So there is now a check that can: tools/data_checks.mjs asserts this number
// against the highest ROUND<N>_NOTES.md in the repository. A round that writes
// its notes and forgets its stamp fails the three-second lane instead of
// reaching somebody's Desktop.
// ROUND 105 -- 105, bumped in the commit that ships it, which is what the
// comment above asks for and what round 104's check now enforces.
// ROUND 108 -- 108, and this bump carries THREE rounds.
//
// 106 (the map intake pipeline), 107 (hand-placed objects) and 108 (the lever
// split) were each committed and each left unshipped, so the build on the
// Desktop stayed at 105 through all three. That is precisely the situation the
// stamp was added for in round 42 -- "three consecutive update packs sat
// unapplied on the Desktop without anyone being able to tell" -- and it
// happened again, this time on the sending side rather than the receiving one.
//
// The round-104 check compares this number against the highest
// ROUND<N>_NOTES.md in the repository, and it could not catch this: the notes
// for 106, 107 and 108 did not exist either, so the check was comparing 105
// against 105 and agreeing. A stamp check is only as good as the thing it is
// checked against, and "the round wrote no notes" was the hole in it.
// ROUND 109 -- 109, bumped in the commit that ships it.
// ROUND 110 -- 110. Ships as a PATCH over the r109 parts already on the Desktop.
// ROUND 111 -- 111. The ability overhaul is complete: coverage 133/133/0.
// ROUND 112 -- 112. The user's six-point review of three generated kits.
// ROUND 113 -- 113. The user's affliction library: 1,088 named afflictions.
// ROUND 114 -- 114. The user's 23 senses, five ranks apiece, and flanking.
// ROUND 115 -- 115. The user's 44 auras, and the sewer's traps.
// ROUND 116 -- 116. Eleven bugs and four updates; the maps turn 45 degrees.
// ROUND 116.1 -- a correction shipped between rounds, on the user's two
// reports: the confluence table defers to the HWFWM TTRPG sheet where the
// sheet has already answered, and a region's map stops drawing its
// neighbours. Point release rather than 117 because neither is new work --
// both are round 116 not finishing something it started.
// ROUND 116.2 -- the user's canonical confluence list: eight authored trios,
// six Doom and two Dragon. Data only; 116.1 built the machinery for it.
// ROUND 116.3 -- the TTRPG sheet's whole Confluence Essences tab: 371
// canonical trios, 101 confluences, imported and cross-checked. Data only.
// ROUND 116.4 -- the raw sheet export is kept beside the derived table and
// the data lane now checks all 2,226 of its rows through confluenceDefFor,
// so the table can never drift from the source without saying so.
// ROUND 117 -- 117. The composed cast: pool draw, recombination, particles.
// Back to an integer, which also un-fails round 41's build-stamp check --
// `/^Playing version \d+$/` has been red since 116.1 because the stamp reads a
// point release. Nobody noticed for four of them: the check lives in an
// [isolated] suite that flaps under contention, so its red was indistinguishable
// from the noise around it.
// ROUND 118 -- 118. The cast palette follows the essence, the ward is halved,
// and every active template is proved to draw something.
// ROUND 119 -- 119. A safe way through the sewer, and a clause that stops
// claiming a cost the ability never charges.
// ROUND 120 -- 120. Weapon essences make weapon abilities, and Spike stops
// pretending to be a javelin.
// ROUND 121 -- 121. Special attacks swing the weapon, and auras stop ticking.
// ROUND 122 -- 122. Every ability knows which essence made it, auras reach the
// condition table, and every aura carries a signature that is its bearer's.
// ROUND 123 -- 123. The bearer's mark comes from their own affliction pool and
// the signature takes a second lever: [Bleeding] on 52% of auras becomes 92
// distinct marks, and 19 mechanical shapes become 97.
// ROUND 124 -- 124. Prism Stubby: the sewer escort, the Society a day later,
// and a companion with no essences the player fills from their own bag.
// ROUND 125 -- 125. Prism's chain: seven jobs, seven kitchens, and an answer
// assembled out of what she actually did -- naming whichever confluence the
// player built her.
// ROUND 126 -- 126. The user's bug report: a rank costs more than the one
// below it, one sitting crosses one rank, and a monster you have outgrown
// stops paying for itself.
// ROUND 127 -- 127. Meditation consolidates your gains instead of taxing
// them, quests feed the same pool, the bars show it filling while you fight,
// and the soul garden opens over your head when you sit down.
// ROUND 128 -- 128. The soul garden gets the user's real flower art, with
// each bed's blooms in its own essence's colour; the window is 40% larger;
// and cancelling the sitting closes it on the keypress.
// ROUND 129 -- 129. Two-tone blooms for the essences that are two things,
// a window twenty per cent wider again with the planters in a grid that
// cannot overlap, and the caption in the user's own words.
// ROUND 130 -- 130. The window grows half as much again and reads clearly;
// and at Silver the garden stops being a window at all -- you stand in your
// own soul, your followers walk it, and M snaps you straight back out.
// ROUND 131 -- 131. One plain grass tile under the whole soul space: the
// ground recedes and the planting is what you look at.
// ROUND 132 -- 132. Meditation works in any town and any building in one;
// the ranks get a damage ladder instead of a single step; monsters circle and
// break away instead of all walking the same straight line; the Society holds
// a chest that outlives the character; and the prologue stops dealing every
// player the same eight stones.
// ROUND 133 -- 133. Nine items: companion kits name their stones, the Society
// splits into a hall and a market with four brokers and two new tracks, the
// nonsense "more behind it" line is deleted, nine red suites go green, quests
// finally mark on the map and places finally have names on it, the sewer is
// twice as wide and Prism just follows, recruiting somebody is a conversation,
// and the aura moves to D-pad down.
// ROUND 134 -- 134. The user's fourteen-item bug report: kill quests stop
// hiding their quarry, the potion slots stop offering food nobody owns, the
// sewer ladder comes up on dry paving, the cultist walks, Prism's confluence
// refuses a stone until she has essences, the editor gains a Cities tab, body
// type 1 gets its dual spears, monsters that keep their distance get something
// to keep it with, dying costs your unbanked xp and leaves your bag where you
// fell, the composer stops front-loading actives and lets an animal stone buy
// its animal, meditation says "Consolidate your gains", the ability headings
// stop printing a quota, companion auras are drawn and follow your toggle, and
// the wilds get harder in four measured ways.
// ROUND 136 -- 136, bumped in the commit that ships it.
//
// Round 135 did real work (the Cities tab's real-art renderer) and did NOT
// bump, because it changed nothing under src/ -- it was a tool-only round, and
// the stamp describes the GAME. Its notes are written now alongside 136's,
// because tools/data_checks.mjs asserts this number against the highest
// ROUND<N>_NOTES.md AND that the notes have no gaps: shipping 136 without
// 135's notes fails the lane, which is the check doing exactly its job.
// ROUND 136.1 -- a point release, because this ships ART.
//
// rebuild_desktop.sh takes TARGET from the highest round on the Desktop, and
// reuses Sparkstone-web only when the folder already stamps TARGET. A patch
// named for the round that is already built would therefore never be applied.
// 136.1 is higher than the r136 part set, so the rebuild lays this over it --
// which is the whole delivery path new art has always taken.
//
// data_checks.mjs floors the stamp before comparing it to the newest notes
// file, so 136.1 still matches ROUND136_NOTES.md.
// ROUND 141 -- 141. The user's sixteen chests, and the rule that the PLACE
// picks the model: a cult's hideout wears its cult's, a landmark an element
// has taken wears that element's, and everywhere else wears the plain wooden
// one its region can afford -- which is how "the majority in the NEK should be
// the wooden chests" comes out at 85% without a die being weighted.
// ROUND 142 -- 142. The two contracts you stand and hold: a siege at a small
// town against waves of one strong species, and a bandit crew raiding a
// homestead for its stores. One wave engine, two stakes -- a life and a yard --
// because a life cannot be got back and property can be defended down to the
// last sack.
// ROUND 143 -- 143. Tree variety by quadrant, blended bilinearly at the
// borders, with groves of 20-30 of another tree; and the forest build cut from
// 3,430ms to ~1,200 by giving the hand-placed claims and the city props the
// same spatial index round 43 gave the rocks. The bar they were failing is
// re-specified per region, which is the number that will still mean something
// once the regions are doubled.
// ROUND 144 -- 144. The world doubles: every region 2048 tiles a side, every
// authored position scaled, every size left alone, and the user's 639
// hand-placed entries TRANSLATED by exactly how far their own settlement moved
// so the wall circuits keep their size and their city. Four times the ground
// for +8.6s of build and +63MB, and per tile the build is twice as fast as it
// was.
// ROUND 145 -- 145. The building review: 1,053 buildings became 586, the lone
// ones went from 61% of the world to 27%, and every house that still stands on
// its own has somebody living at it who ALWAYS has something to ask. Four
// steadings a region in place of 532 scattered shacks, and the review found
// four things round 144 had broken and nobody had looked at: Clark Bottom Farm
// was at the bottom of a lake.
// ROUND 146 -- 146. The backing store goes 960x600 -> 1920x1200 with the camera
// zoom doubling alongside, so the renderer produces 69% of the pixels on screen
// instead of 17% and the view is unchanged at 768x480 world units. No art
// touched, no UI element moved. Ships as 146 rather than the brief's "135"
// because rebuild_desktop.sh takes TARGET from the highest round on the Desktop
// and an r135 patch would never be applied.
// ROUND 147 -- 147. Five squares between market stalls, enforced as a live test
// at placement rather than as arithmetic that a fallback can defeat: 51 of 57
// stalls had a neighbour inside five tiles and now none of 66 does, with no
// market losing one. Plus the user's two tracks -- the Cinderwaste's theme,
// closing the hole the music table has documented since round 104, and a
// wilderness-house track at the 57 lone dwellings round 145 peopled.
// ROUND 148 -- 148. The test estate, not the game: the regression renders at
// half resolution with nearest sampling (?render=0.5&filter=nearest, a knob only
// the harness turns) and 28 suites wait for the world instead of guessing at it.
// 171 min -> 116 min. No gameplay changed; the camera zoom scales with the
// canvas so the visible world is 768 x 480 units either way.
// ROUND 149 -- 149. The user's animation drop: body type 1 goes from ONE run
// animation to 28 (it had been compositing weapon cutouts onto the chest run
// since round 33) and body type 2 from 28 to 44. Packed at the source's native
// 92, which is RUN_CELL, with no resampling. Mapping taken from the repo's own
// records and proven by silhouette rather than guessed.
// ROUND 150 -- 150. The eight folders round 149 refused to guess at, named by
// the user off labelled contact sheets. Seven are packed -- spear with shield,
// sword, scythe, axe, hammer, whip and dagger -- giving body type 1 its first
// spear art in any pairing: 38 idle sheets and 35 real runs. The eighth, two
// staves, is NOT packed: the staff is two-handed and ranged, so no loadout can
// hold one in each hand, and round 150's reachability check now proves that
// rather than assuming it. Four of the eight guesses would have been wrong.
// ROUND 151 -- 151. Not the game: the pipe that delivers it. The user ran the
// rebuild to 150 and the published site served 140, with the build verified,
// the push successful and nothing anywhere saying otherwise -- ten rounds
// delivered and never seen. Every stage proves its own output now: the deploy
// asks the live site what it is serving instead of trusting a push, the entry
// point is stamped with the round at build time, and the page itself says so
// when index.html and version.js disagree. tools/test_rebuild.sh, the one test
// of this path, could not run at all and does now.
// ROUND 152 -- 152. The user's partial-armour bug, both halves. The inventory
// paperdoll had never drawn partial armour at all -- `_portraitSource` had the
// full harness and the bare body and nothing between -- while the world sprite
// had drawn it since round 93. And round 93's "IDLE ONLY... the bare body
// returns the moment they move" is over: all seventeen mapped sets have a run
// now, out of the drop that has been sitting there since round 149.
// ROUND 153 -- 153. The townsfolk leash, which described nothing: 14 of 16
// people measured were outside theirs, the longest for 41.5 seconds at a
// stretch, mostly standing about and chatting. Going home is a STATE now, with
// the same time allowance the journey out has always had, and a walker with
// somewhere to be steps round a wall instead of giving up at it. Longest
// stretch outside a leash: 41.5s -> 4s, and nobody strolls off one at all.
// ROUND 154 -- 154. The ground under every settlement, and why five asks did
// not fix it: every one of them measured 100% PAVED, because TILE_PATH is
// paved in the data and dirt on the screen. Sixteen of twenty-three had never
// had one city tile. They all do now, the small ones are paved to twice their
// radius, and Milrow -- 253 tiles of grass under 62 painted patches -- has a
// floor for the first time, because settlements are stamped after the paint
// rather than before it.
// ROUND 186 -- 186. The street plan for the two promoted cities, and the
// instrument that had been reporting on them. Three hand-written tables keyed
// by settlement id -- the wall square, the city floor, and the road grid's
// block -- none of which round 179's promotions were added to. Slagward had no
// square, so `_cityFloorHalf` returned null, so test_round100's probe divided
// by it and reported 0% road and 0 buildings at ANY radius: both of round
// 184's findings about that city, and the radius revert it argued for, rest on
// a number the probe could not produce. All three tables are derived now.
// ROUND 187 -- 187. Cadence, traced from the user's street map at three times
// the old city's size, and then walled properly: the circuit is pulled out
// clear of every street, opens only where the Nek's three roads (rerouted
// onto the city's own streets) cross it, and stands a gate arch in each of
// those three openings. Houses put through the placement rules they were
// never checked against, temples spread across their district, one 5x7 pond
// of water per park, and the old city's leftovers moved out of the new one.
// ROUND 187.1 -- the user's markup of the top-down plan (brick over excess
// parkland, roads and ponds; straighter roads) and a bridge below the river's
// fork, reached round the outside of the wall. A point release, because r187
// already shipped and the rebuild script skips a round it has already built.
// ROUND 188 -- the other five walled cities rebuilt by Cadence's rules at
// three times the size: a street grid, four districts, all eight temples,
// generated walls with arched gates where the roads come in.
