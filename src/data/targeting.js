// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 201 (items 4.1-4.4) -- TAB TARGETING.
//
// The user:
//
//   "Players need a way to see which enemy is targeted, and to jump between
//    targets."
//   4.1 "I'd like to implement tab targeting. Like World of Warcraft does."
//   4.2 "Targets have a small circle around the base of their feet to indicate
//        they are targeted."
//   4.3 "Targeted enemies have a small frame popup, providing additional
//        details."
//   4.4 "This also allows for more perception powers such as identified
//        weaknesses, healthbar, resistances on the target frame."
//
// Before this round the game had NO notion of a current target -- I checked
// for one and there is not a single reference to `currentTarget`,
// `selectedTarget`, `lockOn` or a target ring anywhere in the source. Every
// ability re-ran its own proximity query at the moment it fired
// (`_nearestMonsterInCone`, `_nearestMonsterWithin`), which has a consequence
// worth stating because it is a real bug the player can see: a single cast
// resolves its fx, its condition and its damage in three separate queries, so
// a bolt could burn one creature and curse another.
//
// So this is not only a convenience. A current target gives every one of those
// call sites ONE answer to "who do you mean", and the cone query becomes the
// fallback for when nothing is selected rather than the authority.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE CYCLE ORDER IS SCREEN-SPACE AND NOT DISTANCE.
//
// WoW's tab cycles through what is in front of you, and "in front of you" on a
// screen is a two-dimensional idea. Ordering by world distance instead reads
// as random the moment two creatures are a similar distance away at different
// bearings, because the order changes under your feet as you walk.
//
// The order here is LEFT TO RIGHT in projected screen space, which on an
// isometric map is stable while you move, matches what the player is looking
// at, and makes a second press of Tab always move the ring the same direction.
// Distance breaks a tie, so two bodies on the same screen column resolve
// nearest-first.

// THE TARGET FRAME (items 4.3 and 4.4).
//
// 4.4 is the interesting half: "This also allows for more perception powers
// such as identified weaknesses, healthbar, resistances on the target frame."
//
// The frame is where a perception FINALLY HAS SOMEWHERE TO PUT A SENTENCE.
// Until now every sense had to express itself as a mark drawn over a creature
// in the world -- a ring, an outline, a triangle, at most a floating word --
// because there was no panel that belonged to one creature. That constraint is
// why `SENSE_FIELDS_PENDING` has sixteen entries: sixteen fields the sense
// tables set and NOTHING READS. That is this project's oldest fault class,
// "written by one side, read by none", and five of them are closed here by
// giving them a row.
//
// EACH ROW NAMES THE SENSE THAT GRANTS IT, and a player with no perception at
// all still gets the top two rows -- name and health bar. A frame that showed
// nothing without a sense would be a frame most builds never see.
// ===========================================================================

/**
 * The frame's rows, in display order. `mods` is `player.passiveMods`.
 *
 * Every row is {key, label, value, sense}. `sense` is the field that unlocked
 * it, or null for the two that are always there -- which is what lets the UI
 * mark a row as "this is your perception talking" and lets `targetingFaults`
 * assert that every gated row actually names a real sense field.
