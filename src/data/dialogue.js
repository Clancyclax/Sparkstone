// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 208 -- A CONVERSATION, NOT A LINE.
//
// The user, with a screenshot of the Elder Scrolls dialogue panel:
//
//   2.1 "NPCs should have a simple version of an elder scrolls dialogue
//        system"
//   2.2 "You interact and they have a semi unique greeting"
//   2.3 "Then you have 3-5 dialogue options"
//   2.4 "The wording needs to sound like human dialogue."
//   2.5 "A goodbye option should always be at the bottom of the list"
//
// WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE. An NPC carried one string, `dialogue`, and
// `_openDialogue(name, text, npc, choices)` printed it with a row of buttons
// whose `act` strings were resolved by a forty-branch if-else in WorldScene.
// Every conversation in the game that had a choice at all -- the god's offer,
// the farm job, the recruitment -- was a hand-wired special case, and there
// was no way to ask anyone a question.
//
// So this file is a TREE, and the scene walks it. The forty-branch chain is
// untouched: those conversations are scripted set-pieces and they still work
// exactly as they did. What is new sits beside it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SHAPE OF A TOPIC.
//
//   { label, say, children, when }
//
//   label     what the PLAYER says, as it appears in the list
//   say       what the NPC says back -- an array, see below
//   children  topic ids this one opens onto
//   when      optional (ctx) => boolean; a topic nobody can reach yet
//
// `say` IS AN ARRAY AND THE PICK IS SEEDED OFF THE SPEAKER. This is the whole
// of rule 2.4 in one decision. A single string per topic means every farmer in
// Pallimustus answers "ask about monsters" with the same twelve words, which
// is not human dialogue however well those words are chosen -- it is a sign
// nailed to a person. Keyed on the NPC's name, so one villager always answers
// the same way (they have a view, and it does not change between visits) and
// the next villager answers differently.
//
// The variants are also deliberately not paraphrases of each other. Three
// people asked about the missing give three different pieces of a thing none
// of them can see whole, which is how rumour actually works and is what makes
// 2.3.1.1 land without anyone delivering a briefing.
// ===========================================================================

/** Stable, seeded off the speaker AND the topic, so one person's answers are
 *  consistent with each other and two people's differ. */
export function pickFor(name, topicId, n) {
  if (!n) return 0;
  let h = 2166136261;
  const s = `${name || '?'}|${topicId}`;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) { h ^= s.charCodeAt(i); h = Math.imul(h, 16777619); }
  return Math.abs(h) % n;
}

// ===========================================================================
// THE STANDARD TREE.
//
// The user's own outline, followed branch for branch. Their indentation is
// the nesting; their wording is the topic.
// ===========================================================================

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 210 -- A VOICE, NOT A STYLE.
//
// The user, reading round 209's shipped lines:
//
//   "Lets run a pass on dialogue to review it it all sounds AI generated
//    instead of like dialogue. This cadence 'Research writes things down so
//    someone else can repeat them. They write things down so nobody can' is
//    very overtly AI sounding. A NPC should have their own voice in a sense."
//
// Correct, and measuring it was worse than reading it. A detector over the
// 134 shipped lines: 34% tripped at least one tell, and 39 of them ended on a
// short reversing sentence -- "Not dying loud -- quiet.", "That's rather my
// point.", "That's not glory, that's arithmetic." Every one of those is the
// SAME rhetorical move, which means every one of 148 townsfolk was me being
// clever in a hat.
//
// THE DEEPER FAULT, which the user's own examples show and the detector
// cannot: everybody I wrote was articulate, and everybody knew something.
// Their remote farmer has not heard of the Division at all --
//
//   "Uhh, can't say I've heard of them. But If they are really helping to
//    draw out essence powers thats good news for all of us aint it."
//
// -- and that is a better line than anything in round 209, because ignorance
// is a character trait and I had not given a single person one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SO: VOICES.
//
// Every line is tagged with the kind of person who says it, and an NPC draws
// only from their own. Six, from the user's four examples plus the two the
// catalogue obviously needs:
//
//   rustic  out past the last fence. Dialect, hasn't heard, hopes it's fine.
//   market  town trades and gossip. Hedges, half-believes, trails off.
//   blunt   guard, soldier, labourer. Short. Says how he feels, plainly.
//   devout  temple. Formal, evasive, corrects itself mid-sentence.
//   posh    clerks, nobles, ledgers. Precise, distancing, bureaucratic.
//   weary   old, bereaved, done. Flat and short -- and RATIONED, because it
//           is the voice I default to and the one the complaint was about.
//
// `voiceFor` assigns one per NPC off their role and a hash of their name, so
// two farmers in one village are not the same farmer.
// ===========================================================================

/** A line, and who talks like that. */
