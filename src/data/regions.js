// ROUND 43 -- THE FOUR REGIONS OF PALLIMUSTUS.
//
// The user's world design, encoded. Everything the world generator needs to
// build a region lives here as data: where it sits in the world grid, what
// its ground is made of, which settlements stand in it, where its water and
// roads run, which ranks of monster live there and in what group sizes, and
// what it takes to leave.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY ONE ARRAY AND NOT FOUR MAPS
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The tile map is a flat Uint8Array and anything outside it has no floor at
// all (the round-36 temples proved that the hard way -- they sat outside the
// array and rendered as black rooms for five rounds). So all four regions
// live in ONE array as a 2x2 grid of REGION_TILES squares, with a reserved
// INTERIOR BAND of rows below them for every interior. Travel between
// regions is a gate, a ship or a portal -- never a walk across a border --
// so their grid adjacency is bookkeeping, not geography.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// RANK IS THE REGION'S PROPERTY, NOT THE DISTANCE'S
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Round 41 capped coin rank by distance band. From here the REGION sets the
// band and distance-from-arrival only shifts the mix inside it: The Nek is
// Normal/Iron wherever you stand, Bratugal is Bronze/Silver/Gold wherever
// you stand. `spawnGroups[].from` is the fraction of the region's radius at
// which a group starts appearing, which is what "the standard danger
// increasing as you move farther away from the spawn point" means once rank
// itself is fixed by where you are in the world.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// PACKS AND SUPER PACKS
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The user, verbatim: "When I say 'packs' and 'super packs' I'm referring to
// groups of the same monster together. The intent is to allow players to
// feel how much stronger their abilities are getting as they move from
// killing 1-2 of a creature to dozens, while also demonstrating how much
// tougher enemies are getting at each rank." So a group is one SPECIES
// repeated, and the size band is the whole point: 10-30 of a rank you have
// outgrown, 2-8 of your own rank, 1 of the rank above you.
//
// TIERS ARE RANKS. monsterThreatTier returns 0-4 and the coin ladder already
// reads that as normal/iron/bronze/silver/gold (monsters.js
// COIN_RANK_BY_TIER). DIAMOND IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT -- the user's note:
// "no region is actually diamond rank and no monsters should be diamond
// rank", so tier 4 (gold) is the ceiling anywhere in the world.

// ROUND 134 (item 6) -- WHAT A PAINT STROKE MAY BE MADE OF.
//
// The user asked for a region's terrain -- "biomes and coastline" -- to be
// editable in the desktop editor. A region's `terrain` array is a list of
// painted rectangles, each naming one of these; `_stampTerrainPatch` in
// WorldScene writes them into `tileType` after every generator has had its
// say, so a stroke is a correction that wins.
//
// A SHORT LIST, ON PURPOSE. `tileType` carries eighteen values and most of
// them are not terrain: TILE_CITY, TILE_STREET, TILE_PLAZA and TILE_DOCK are
// things a settlement or a jetty STAMPS and mean "a town is here", so
// painting one would claim a town that does not exist -- the streets would
// draw and nothing would stand on them. TILE_VOID is the dark beyond a room
// and TILE_GARDEN belongs to the soul space.
//
// What is left is the five surfaces a coastline and a biome band are actually
// made of: ground, rough ground, and the three depths of water. That is
// enough to widen a bay, cut an inlet, run a shoal along a shore, or push a
// band of peaks another mile south -- which is the whole of what was asked.

// this round made that obvious:
//
//   'mountain' is four different biomes in one pack -- grey rock (0-3, 13),
//   snow and ice (4-7, 14-15) and desert sand (8-12). Picking uniformly from
//   all sixteen scattered snow, stone and dune across the same hillside like
//   confetti.
//
//   'slate_dark' is not slate at all: it is dark, rippling, murky WATER, fish
//   included. Elehyd named it as its GROUND, so the entire badlands region
//   was rendering as the bottom of a lake.
//
// So a region can now name a subset of a pack's frames per role rather than
// the whole pack. Absent an entry, all of a pack's frames are used, which is
// what every other pack wants.

  // which is the only way any of this was ever going to be decided.
  //
  // These subsets were FIRST picked by measuring mean hue, luminance and
  // saturation per tile. That failed: `sirukh` still checkerboarded, because a
  // saturation threshold cannot tell pink clay from cream sand when both are
  // pale and both are warm. The lists below were picked BY EYE off labelled

  // union for anything that asks for the role directly.
  //
  // This is the other half of the checkerboard, and curation alone would not
  // have fixed it: the pack draw picked `subset[hash % subset.length]` per

  //
  // TWELVE TILES, from two deliveries in the same round ("more lava tiles to
  // increase variety"), read as one list rather than as a pack and an
  // expansion -- a tile belongs to the banks or the channel because of how
  // much of it is glowing, not because of which sheet it arrived in. Measured,
  // the second delivery is much the brighter, and splitting by sheet would
  // have put five molten tiles in the banks.
  //
  // THE MEASUREMENT GIVES THE ORDERING; WHERE TO CUT IS A DESIGN CALL, and
  // `extract_round177_lava.py` prints both candidates rather than applying one
  // quietly. The largest numeric gap is the WRONG cut:
  //
  //     3.5% -> 18.9%   a 15-point gap, but it leaves THREE bank tiles
  //    27.1% -> 31.2%   a 4-point gap, and the one that ships
  //
  // Cinder holds 2,225 shallow tiles against 3,706 deep, so three variants on
  // the banks repeat where a player walks and seven in the channel do not.
  // The second break is also where the PICTURES divide: everything below it is
  // dark rock with a seam or an ember in it, everything above is bright enough
  // that the rock is the minority of the tile.
  //
  // AND THE CHANNEL IS WEIGHTED, which is the one thing the screenshot said
  // that the numbers did not. `_groundTileVisual` picks with `sub[hash %
  // sub.length]` -- a flat uniform draw over whatever is in the list -- and
  // three of the seven molten tiles carry a STRONG MOTIF: spirals (8), a ring
  // of bubbles (6), and dark shapes suspended in the flow (11). Uniform, those
  // three are 43% of a nine-tile-wide river and the eye picks the pattern out
  // immediately; the four plainer ones (a pool, crazed cracks, a lattice, a
  // flow) are what a river should mostly be made of.
  //
  // Listed twice, because repeating an entry is how you weight a uniform draw
  // without teaching the picker a second concept. The motifs fall to 3 in 11
  // and read as things you come across rather than as wallpaper.

// Ontaria needs two ways on and had room for one. Measured at the end of round
// 179, the consequence was not theoretical -- the exits formed the straight
// line nek -> ontaria -> elehyd -> bratugal and Sirukh Sands, the Cinderwaste
// and Ixcuatl were reachable from nothing at all.
//
// `exits` is the authored table now. `exit` is DERIVED and keeps its old
// meaning exactly -- "the way the main spine continues" -- so the half-dozen
// places that ask a region where the story goes next still get that answer and
// did not have to learn about limbs. The ones that mean "every way out of
// here" (the landmark builder, the exit pads) iterate `exits`.
//
// Deriving it rather than authoring both is the point: two hand-written copies
// of "which exit is the main one" is the fault class round 179 spent itself
// removing, and this file would have been the eighth place to keep in step.

// pixel of that pack's own sheet, scaled to the lightness register the map
// already uses (the existing grass colour is a good deal darker than the
