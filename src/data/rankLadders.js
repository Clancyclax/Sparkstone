// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 202 (item 3) -- A RANK-UP EITHER SAYS SOMETHING TRUE AND NEW, OR
// SAYS NOTHING AT ALL.
//
// The user, with a screenshot of three cards in a row:
//
//   "Still seeing lots of abilities with generated filler text that has no
//    meaning or context. Review all ability generation, remove anything like
//    the screenshot. Abilities that compare themselves as better than themself
//    are nonsensical and read as AI slop. My theory is the generator is keeping
//    track of a baseline ability and then if it rolls better in some way it's
//    trying to state that. It should not tell the player that. Variation in
//    abilities is fine, but they dont need to tell players if a move is better
//    than it could have been. It has no bearing on the ability at that point."
//
// THE THEORY IS RIGHT ABOUT THE MECHANISM AND WRONG ABOUT THE TRIGGER, which
// is worth writing down because it changes what had to be fixed. Nothing
// compares a roll to a statistical baseline. What the generator compares an
// ability to is AN EARLIER RANK OF ITSELF, and the result reads identically:
//
//   Effect (iron):   The working holds a tenth further than it did.
//   Effect (bronze): The working holds a fifth further again.
//   Effect (gold):   The working holds a quarter further still.
//
// Measured over 189 kits / 3,780 abilities before this round:
//
//   * `it comes back 10% sooner` was the single most-printed sentence in the
//     game, on 14.1% of all abilities -- and 53.5% of those were PASSIVES WITH
//     NO COOLDOWN. The comment that justified keeping it said it was fine
//     because "a cooldown that comes back sooner has a referent the reader can
//     see". On more than half of them there was no referent at all.
//   * 27.6% of abilities carrying a potency label printed IDENTICAL NUMBERS at
//     iron and gold, because the field the label claimed to scale
//     (`familiarDmg`, `armorBonus`, `escort.dmg`, `regenPerSec`,
//     `cooldownReduction`) is not in essenceRank's SCALED_FIELDS. The label was
//     attached to nothing whatsoever.
//
// AND THE PROJECT HAD ALREADY DECIDED THIS ONCE. Round 103, quoting the user:
// "Abilities are still listing pointless text ... 10% stronger has no context,
// 10% stronger than what?" That round removed the potency bit from the merged
// card line and left the per-rank labels, on the stated grounds that they were
// only ever shown "at the moment a rank is announced ... This is the card,
// which is a reference." Round 190 then rebuilt the card out of the per-rank
// labels and put every one of them back on it. The rule was right; the
// regression was putting the announcement's voice on the reference.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES, in three parts:
//
//   1. A RUNG NAMES A MECHANIC, not a magnitude. "It also cleanses one
//      condition" is a rank-up. "It mends a fifth further" is a percentage of
//      a number printed four lines above.
//   2. A RUNG MAY ONLY CLAIM A FIELD THE SPEC ACTUALLY HAS. `requires` is
//      checked against the finished spec, so a passive with no cooldown cannot
//      be told its cooldown improved.
//   3. A RANK WITH NOTHING TO ADD ADDS NOTHING. The card already skips an
//      empty rank line, and `Numbers now:` carries the magnitude -- which is
//      where the reader was already looking.
//
// Growth in magnitude did not go away and was never the problem: essenceRank's
// SCALED_FIELDS still scale every rank, and the card prints the scaled figures.
// What went away is the sentence announcing that they did.

// 1. THE FILLER GUARD.
//
// The specific sentences are deleted below. This is the part that keeps them
// deleted: a pattern list and a predicate the suite runs over EVERY generated
// description and EVERY rank clause in a live kit. The class of fault is
// "a comparative with no referent", and naming the class rather than the
// strings is what stops the next round reinventing one.

  // the game. The fault is a clause whose WHOLE SUBJECT is the ability
  // itself -- "it works 24% harder" -- so the pattern requires that subject.

  // you and the next hit" names exactly what there is more of, and a census
  // over 2,400 generated abilities found 83 such clauses caught as filler --

// ROUND 204c -- THE RULE THE SIX PATTERNS ABOVE ARE ALL INSTANCES OF.
//
// The user, on `Effect (iron): ... It costs a quarter less to put up.`:
//
//   "a quarter less than what!? ... At bronze that might make sense, it can be
//    cheaper than it was at iron, but at iron the ability didn't exist before
//    so that statement, just like the last 5 times I've noted similar
//    statements, is just fluff that doesn't mean anything to the player."
//
// Five times, and every previous fix added one more PHRASING to the list
// above. That list is lexical -- it knows "harder", "further", "a quarter
// harder" -- so each round it catches the sentence that was reported and
// misses the one written next. "A quarter less" was not on it. Neither was
// "half again as long", which was in the same ladder.
//
// The structural rule underneath all six:
//
//   A DELTA NEEDS A PRIOR VALUE. Iron is where an ability begins, so at iron
//   there is no prior value and every delta is a comparison to nothing.
//
// That is checkable without knowing which words the next author picks, and it
// is what `rankLadderFaults` asserts now. At BRONZE and above a delta is fine
// and is often the clearest thing a rank can say -- the user says so in the
// same message -- so the rule is scoped to the rank where it is a statement
// about nothing, rather than being a ban on deltas.
//
// Deliberately NOT applied to the prose descriptions. "Its damage rises +6%
// for every 100 paces travelled" is a relative magnitude that names exactly
// what varies it, and a rule this blunt would delete it. Rungs are short,
// subject-less sentences about the ability itself, which is what makes the

// longer be told its cooldown improved.
//
// `requires` may be a field name, a list (any one of them), or null for a rung
// that stands on its own. `grants` is the field the runtime applies; it exists
// so `rankLadderFaults` can assert that no rung is a label with nothing behind
// it -- the exact fault that put "a quarter further still" on 27.6% of cards

// fault wearing new words -- round 134's "one ability offered twice", between
// abilities rather than between ranks.
//
// So a rank offers two or three rungs and the ability picks one, seeded by its
// own name. Three choices at four ranks is eighty-one ladders per archetype

  //   3  "A whip essence may not instantly provide a Dexterity Weapon
  //      proficiency, but by bronze or silver it should be nearly impossible
  //      that one of the abilities hasn't filled in that gap."
  //   4  "I'm not seeing any weapon essences providing weapon summons anymore,
  //      along with proficiency, and buffs to wielding a specific weapon ...
  //      these don't all need to be at iron rank, they could even be on 1
  //      ability coming as you progress from iron, to bronze to silver on an
  //      ability like Whip Mastery or Spear Mastery."
  //
  // So this is the ladder that ability climbs, and it is the ONE place a
  // weapon essence's three promises live. Its iron rung is the proficiency
  // itself, which is the part round 202 already granted; bronze and silver are
  // the two things that were missing.
  //
  // Not a pool of three per rank, unlike every other ladder here: a mastery
  // line is a PROGRESSION rather than a choice, and the user named the order
  // ("proficiency at iron, add increased damage, range, or speed at bronze,
  // and then add triggered effects as silver"). A rung picked at random from
  // three would make two Spear Masteries teach different halves of the spear.

  //
  // The user, having chosen what a two-weapon build resolves to:
  //
  //   4    "Lets says 2+ weapon essences always result in the arsenal
  //         confluence."
  //   4.1  "The arsenal confluence should at Iron, or bronze always have an
  //         ability that applies bonuses for any weapon essence to every
  //         weapon essence they have."
  //   4.1.1 "This should be a passive that allows synergy between multiple
  //         weapon types so a player with a whip and spear essence are
  //         rewarded with buffs from both. I.e. Hammer Mastery and Spears
  //         fury apply their effects to both Axes and Spears."
  //   4.1.2 "Special attack weilding requirements should also be eliminated
  //         as a rank up affect."
  //   4.1.3 "This gives the Arsenal Confluence a specific identity (The player
  //         is an arsenal, any weapon in their hands tied to their essences is
  //         as deadly as every weapon.)"
  //
  // A PROGRESSION, like `mastery` and for the same reason: the user named the
  // order, iron first and the wielding requirements after. Three Arsenals that
  // each learned a different third of being an arsenal would be the thing
  // nobody asked for.
  //
  // The gold rung is the identity in 4.1.3 taken one step past its own
  // wording, which is where a gold rung belongs: at iron through silver the
  // sharing is bounded by "tied to their essences", and at gold the player IS
  // the arsenal and the binding is anything they can pick up. 4.1.4 -- "Some
  // limitations may need to be placed onto Staffs and Bows. Will playtest and
  // find out" -- is deliberately NOT anticipated here: a limit invented before
  // the playtest is a limit nobody measured.

  //
  //   "Its a damage increase, but half of the ability is framed around being
  //    some sort of shield. Based on the description I don't know if the
  //    bronze or silver effects can even trigger."

  // They could not, and the cause was one line at the bottom of
  // `ladderKeyFor`: `return 'guard'`. Anything that matched none of the nine
  // tests -- every `selfPower`, `selfCritBuff`, `statBuff` and `bloomField` in
  // the game -- was handed the shield ladder by default. Measured before the
  // fix: 8 abilities in 1,400 reached `guard` while carrying nothing defensive
  // at all, and many more legitimately-defensive ones had no pool to break.
  //
  // A fallback that is a REAL ARCHETYPE is the fault here. "I don't know what
  // this is" and "this is a shield" have to be different answers, or the next
  // template nobody classified becomes a shield too, silently, for a round or
  // ten. So the unmatched case lands here instead: a timed effect you put on

// the FIELD with it, which `test_round89` caught immediately: an ability's card
// printed base 13 at iron and base 13 at gold, with the rank doing nothing to
// the figures at all.
//
// The announcement was the fault. The growth was never the fault. So every

// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 215 -- AN IRON RUNG MAY NOT DESCRIBE AN IMPROVEMENT.
//

//
//   "The run no longer breaks when you move. Its fucking iron rank this is
//    the same thing again. It can't no longer do something this is the first
//    tier of this ability. Every single time you go to fix this it comes back
//    with new wording. Stop stating iron rank abilities are better than they
//    were or could have been."
//
// They are right about the fix as well as the fault. Every previous pass
// rewrote the SENTENCE that was reported, and the next census found the same
// thing wearing different words -- "a miss does not break the run" is the
// identical claim and sat two lines below the one screenshotted. This is the
// project's fault class 5 in its purest form.
//
// So this round does not rewrite a sentence. It states the PROPERTY and
// checks it:
//
//   Iron is the first tier an ability has. There is no earlier state, so
//   nothing at iron can be a change from one. An iron rung says what the
//   ability IS. Bronze, silver and gold may compare, because by then there
//   is something to compare to.
//
// Nine rungs violated it, not one. The checks below are on CONSTRUCTIONS
// rather than on strings, and they run over the ladder table AND over the
// rendered rung of a large sample of real abilities, because the table is not
// the only place a sentence can be born.
// ===========================================================================

// TWO SCOPES, TWO STRICTNESSES, and the difference is the whole of getting
// this right rather than merely getting it to fail.

// condition" at iron really is additive-to-nothing and really is wrong.
//
// The ABILITY'S OWN BODY is a paragraph about what the whole ability does,
// and "Using it also restores 5 health" is additive to the ability's OTHER
// effect in the same sentence. "+5% harder to hit" is measured against the
// character's baseline. Neither is a claim that the ability used to be worse.
//
// The first cut of this guard ran the strict set over generated body text and
// convicted 1,970 of 4,000 iron lines, nearly all of them correct English
// describing real effects. That is round 210's lesson arriving in a new file:
// a guard that convicts good writing is a guard that gets switched off, and
