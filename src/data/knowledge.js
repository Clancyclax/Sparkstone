// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 92 -- KNOWLEDGE, IN HER OWN VOICE, ON HER OWN TRIGGERS.
//
//   "The text of knowledge's introduction needs heavy improvement. It
//    currently is very overtly AI written and doesn't feel accurate to the
//    world."
//
//   "The pacing of knowledges advice doesn't make sense. After improving the
//    text itself the triggers need to be relevant to the information."
//
//   "Review how knowledge is written within the books. Generally as a 'she',
//    slightly humorous, but patient and helpful."
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SHE, FIRST OF ALL
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// DESIGN_STORY.md has had it right since the beginning -- "Knowledge -- the
// goddess -- speaks into their mind" -- and round 82's sewer file wrote the
// character note as "He is a god explaining something obvious to someone who
// has just died", which is wrong twice over. She is not explaining something
// obvious and she is not contemptuous about it. Every reference in the code is
// hers now.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG WITH THE OLD TEXT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Naming it precisely, because "sounds AI-written" is a symptom and the cause
// is a set of habits that can be avoided deliberately:
//
//   * IT ENDED EVERY BEAT ON AN APHORISM. "That is the whole system.
//     Everything else is arithmetic." / "People die holding full flasks. Do
//     not be one." Six lines, six punchlines. Nobody talks like that; it is
//     the rhythm of a pull quote, and six in a row reads as a machine that has
//     learned the shape of an ending.
//   * IT WAS CLIPPED TO THE POINT OF COLDNESS. "Armour is armour. Put it on."
//     was written to sound laconic and lands as bored. The brief is patient.
//   * IT WAS FUNNY AT THE PLAYER'S EXPENSE. "it is holding a weapon because
//     you had the sense to pick one up, or it is not because you did not" is a
//     joke about the player being stupid, delivered before they have done
//     anything.
//   * IT EXPLAINED SYSTEMS RATHER THAN THINGS. "Sixteen sockets. Twenty
//     abilities, once the innate ones are counted." A goddess does not have a
//     feature list.
//
// So: she is warm, she is unhurried, her humour is dry and aimed at the
// situation rather than at the player, and she describes what is true about
// the world rather than what is true about the interface. She likes this
// person. She is not worried, which is itself reassuring.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AND THE TRIGGERS ARE EVENTS, NOT FLOOR TILES
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Round 82 fired six tidbits by walking onto six marked tiles, and it was a
// real improvement on Act 0's eight pages of exposition -- the potion line was
// beside a potion. But a tile is a guess about what the player has done, and
// the guesses were wrong in both directions: the essence lecture fired on a
// tile whether or not the player had ever seen an essence (they had not -- the
// sewer's 'e' marks are STONES, and the first essence in the game is the
// cultist's drop, two chambers later), and a player who picked up a sword in
// a dead end got the attack lecture whenever they wandered back onto the path.
//
// The ask replaces the guess with the thing itself:
//
//     "2.1.1) Picking up a weapon      2.1.4) Picking up an awakening stone
//      2.1.2) Picking up quintessence  2.1.5) Killing a monster
//      2.1.3) Picking up an essence    2.1.6) firsts in general, waking up,
//                                             escaping the sewer, encountering
//                                             the cultist."
//
// Every line below hangs off something the player DID, and fires the first
// time they ever do it. That makes the pacing correct by construction rather
// than by placement: the essence line cannot fire before there is an essence,
// because an essence being picked up is what fires it.
//
// FOR THE WHOLE GAME, not just the prologue -- which the ask settles by
// including quintessence. Quintessence comes off a kill (`_dropLootFromKill`
// rolls it on every monster in the game, sewer slimes included) and cores come
// off every monster guaranteed, so both CAN land down there; but a player who
// misses them in the sewer should still be told what they are the first time
// they see one, whether that is on hour one or hour six.
//
// ONE LINE EACH, ONCE EVER. `player.knowledgeSaid` is an array of ids and an
// ordinary player field, so saves.js carries it with no work at all (its loop
// copies every player field, and an array survives `plain()`). A god who
// repeats herself is a tutorial pop-up.
