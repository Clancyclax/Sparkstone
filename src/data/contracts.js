// ============================================================================
// ROUND 94 -- THE ADVENTURE SOCIETY BOARD.
//
// THE USER'S DESIGN, verbatim, because every rule below is one of its clauses:
//
//   "1.1) It needs updated to 'adventure society board' and bounties need
//    renamed to contracts.
//    1.2) It should list 25 contracts requiring 1 star, 2 stars or 3 stars and
//    specifying the rank of the contract (I.e. iron rank, bronze etc)
//    1.3) You can see but can't accept 'contracts' that are above your star,
//    but you can accept contracts 1 step above your rank with a team.
//    1.4) Contracts need broken into 3 tiers.
//    1.4.1) 1 star contracts are simple kill this monster plaguing our town,
//    or defend an individual while they harvest some nodes on the map. (Bonus
//    for if the NPC doesn't take any damage, or if the party has to face
//    another threat while fighting the contracted monster.
//    1.4.2) 2 star contracts require a little investigation... (Bonuses for
//    speed and clearing the quest quickly)
//    1.4.3) 3 star contracts are political... (Bonus is about exercising good
//    judgement)
//    1.5) Bonus rewards can be epic gear, an awakening stone, an essence, or
//    discounts at the adventurer society on the next few purchases."

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND quests.js DOES NOT ABSORB IT
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// quests.js knows how to POST a notice: six objective kinds, a weekly seed, a
// payout ladder. It has no opinion about who is allowed to take one, because
// until now nobody was refused. What this round adds is a gate -- two of them,
// crossing -- and a gate is a different kind of thing from a generator. Keeping
// it here means `canAcceptContract` is one function with one table behind it
// rather than four `if` branches grown into the board's render loop, which is
// how the old `taken` flag ended up checked in three places.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TWO GATES, AND WHY THEY ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The STAR gate is absolute. Stars are the Society's own grading of you and
// nobody lends you theirs; a two-star contract in a one-star adventurer's hands
// is the Society failing at the only thing it does. So: seen, never taken.
//
// The RANK gate is one step soft, and the softener is a team. That is the
// user's rule and it is the right one for this setting -- ranking up is slow
// and being carried by better company is how everybody's first bronze fight
// actually happens. Two steps up is still refused, because at that distance the
// team is not helping you, it is doing it.
//
// Both gates SHOW the row. A contract you cannot take yet is the clearest
// statement the board can make about what you are working toward, and hiding it
// would make the board shrink as the player got worse at meeting it.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A CONTRACT'S RANK IS ITS TIER'S RANK, AND THE STAR RAISES BOTH TOGETHER
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The tempting version -- roll a rank label for flavour and leave the quarry
// where the region put it -- is a lie about difficulty, and the board would be
// caught in it the first time somebody took a "silver rank" contract and killed
// it in four swings. So the star raises the CONTRACT'S TIER, and the rank label
// is read off the tier it actually got. A three-star posting in a tier-1 region
// is a tier-3 posting: the quarry is scaled by the same bountyHpMult the rest
// of the game already applies to a tagged target, and the word "silver" over it
// is true.

 *   den    -- "finding where a monster's den is". The contract does NOT tell

 *             a trail from there. You follow it on the ground; the den goes on

 *             `gather`: a named person wants TWO different things, which is an
 *             order rather than an errand, and they are the one you bring it to.

 *             that actually travels, and people rather than wildlife coming for
 *             it. bandits.js is the roster; this is what it is for.
 *

// `questPayout` prices a notice off the QUARRY'S XP -- monsterXp * 2.4 * a tier
// multiplier -- and then `applyBountyFloor` clamps the result to 5 iron. Both
// halves of that are broken in the same direction:
//
//   * The floor swallowed the bottom. The smallest thing the formula could
//     produce was 14 normal coins and the largest a Normal- or Iron-rank
//     posting could produce was a few hundred, so the clamp fired on nearly all
//     of them and HALF A 25-ROW BOARD ADVERTISED THE IDENTICAL NUMBER. Flagged
//     in the round 94, 95 and 96 notes and carried each time.
//   * The ceiling never arrived. Run the formula at the top of the ladder --
//     a gold-tier quarry at ~400xp, tier 4, the relic multiplier -- and it pays
//     about 69 iron. A GOLD-RANK CONTRACT PAID TWO-THIRDS OF A BRONZE COIN.
//     Five ranks of progression that the purse could not see.
//
// Both are the same mistake: the payout was derived from the monster instead of
// from the GRADE. The Society is not buying a corpse, it is buying work it has
// graded, and the grade is (rank, star). So that pair is now the payout, and
// the old effort formula is demoted to deciding WHERE INSIDE THE BAND a given
// posting falls -- which is what keeps a survey cheaper than a relic without
// letting either escape its rank.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE BAND, IN THE CONTRACT'S OWN COIN
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The user's three numbers are all iron-rank, so the table is written in the
// units they were stated in -- coins OF THE CONTRACT'S OWN RANK -- and the rank
// chooses the denomination. Their iron row reads back exactly:
//
//   1 star iron -> 5..50 iron       (5 iron IS "500 normal rank coins")
//   2 star iron -> 50..100 iron
//   3 star iron -> 100..1000 iron   (100 iron IS "1 bronze", 1000 IS "10")
//
// The bands are CONTIGUOUS by construction: a one-star tops out exactly where a
// two-star starts. That is what makes the board legible as a ladder -- the best
// one-star row on it is worth the worst two-star row, so a player reading down
// the board can see what a star is actually worth rather than being told.
//
// Note the star pays TWICE, and deliberately. `contractTierFor` already lifts a
// three-star posting's tier (and therefore its rank, and therefore its
// denomination), and the band lifts it again inside that rank. A three-star
// political case is five rows of a twenty-five row board and is the only work
// on it that can be got WRONG while being finished; it should be the difference
// between a job and a career.

// ROUND 97 -- AND HOW MUCH NORMAL-RANK WORK A BOARD CARRIES.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE USER, on the bottom of the ladder:
//
//   "There should be very few normal rank contracts. Normal rank is basically
//    the slimes in the initial sewers and a few just outside town. In the book
//    you only see normal rank monsters in the first 30 pages and then never
//    again through the next 13 books."
//
// That is a statement about the WORLD, not about the payout, and it caught a
// thing the payout work only made visible. Measured on three real boards before
// this existed: Milrow posted 7 normal-rank contracts of 25 and Fenn Cross
// posted 11. A board is graded off its region's own threat bands, The Nek holds
// bands 0 and 1, and a fair roll between them makes half of every starting
// board normal rank -- which reads as a world where normal-rank monsters are a
// standing profession rather than the first thirty pages.
//
// So a posting that rolls tier 0 is LIFTED to tier 1 unless a small seeded roll
// says otherwise. Not zero: the Society does post the odd normal-rank notice,
// and a board with none of them would have nothing for a player who has just
// come up out of the sewer. Two rows of twenty-five is "a few just outside
// town"; twelve is a career.
//
// Applied to the TIER, before the quarry is drawn, for the same reason
// `contractTierFor` is: the grade and the thing you are sent at have to agree,
// and a rank raised after the pool was picked is the exact lie the round-94
// header exists to prevent.
// A PLAN, NOT A PROBABILITY -- and the first draft of this was the probability.
//
// Written as "a tier-0 roll survives 8% of the time", measured across every
// board in the world, and the answer came back: 325 rows, ZERO of them normal
// rank. Tier 0 has to be rolled first and then survive, so two small odds
// multiplied into none at all -- while the fault check, which asked the helper
// whether it kept 8% of the rolls it was handed, passed. An assertion about a
// table is not an assertion about the build, again.
//
// Worse, the board it produced could not be used: a fresh Normal-rank
// adventurer standing alone at Cadence's board could accept NOTHING on it. The
// star gate is absolute and the rank gate needs a team, so a board with no
// normal-rank work is a wall for exactly the player the first star is for.
//
// So the count is fixed the way CONTRACT_STAR_MIX fixes the star mix: every
// board that stands in a region holding tier-0 threats carries this many
// normal-rank notices, always, and the rest are lifted to iron. Two of
// twenty-five is "a few just outside town" and is also the smallest number that
// leaves the opening playable solo.
