// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 202 (item 2) -- WEAPON PROFICIENCIES.
//
// The user's rulings, in their own numbering:
//
//   2.1   "Can't wield a staff (or wand later addition) without magical tool
//          proficiency"
//   2.1.1 "Staff and wands use mana instead of stamina to attack."
//   2.2   "Proficiency should halve weapon swing stamina cost for non magical
//          weapons"
//   2.3   "Polearm proficiency (scythes, spears)"
//   2.4   "Power proficiency (hammers, axes)"
//   2.5   "Dexterity proficiency (Bows, whips)"
//   2.6   "Blade proficiency (sword, dagger)"
//   2.7   "Stamina cost for weapons is increased each tier. Without an
//          appropriate weapon proficiency skill the player will burn lots of
//          stamina to use them."
//   2.8   "Obviously this means that weapon essences should have a high chance
//          to roll related weapon proficiencies"
//
// And, separately: "As a note magical tools are staffs (wands have not yet
// been added)." So `magicalTools` grants `staff` today and the wand row is
// written and commented rather than invented -- `PENDING_GRANTS` holds it, so
// the day a wand is added it is one line moved rather than a table to
// rediscover.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY MAGICAL TOOLS ARE THE ONLY HARD GATE.
//
// 2.1 says you CANNOT wield a staff untrained. 2.7 says everything else is
// merely expensive. That asymmetry is the design, not an oversight, and it
// falls out of 2.1.1: a staff's attack does not spend stamina at all, so
// "burns lots of stamina" has nothing to bite on. A staff in untrained hands
// would be a strictly free weapon. Every other proficiency is a discount, and
// the untrained price is the real one rather than a punishment.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS A DATA MODULE.
//
// The same reason advancement.js and hotkeys.js are: four surfaces have to
// agree about what a weapon costs and who may hold it -- the equip door, the
// swing, the card that quotes the price, and the generator that grants the
// passive. A rule that lives in the swing path and is restated in the tooltip
// is a rule that drifts, and this project has the scar tissue to prove it.
