// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 196 -- NINE MODES OF TRANSPORT.
//
// The user: "Create 10 different color variations for each vehicle and
// transports are for sale in every city. Add a new vendor in the adventurer
// society market hall."
//
// WHAT THIS ROUND DOES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The ask covers four systems --
// the vehicles themselves, a vendor, travelling in one, and nine interiors up
// to an 80x80 dragon-house on three levels with its own merchant hall. Asked
// where to stop, the user chose VEHICLES AND THE VENDOR. So this file is
// written whole: every number the later rounds need is authored here now --
// the terrain a vehicle may cross, the ambush chance a tile of travel carries,
// the shape of each interior -- and those rounds read it rather than deriving
// it again from the brief. What this round USES is the art, the prices, the
// colourways and the shop.
//
// THE COLOURWAYS ARE PAINTED, NOT DELIVERED. Ten finished sheets per vehicle
// would be ninety files and about 90 MB of atlas for something the player sees
// one of. The game already paints a townsperson's clothes at runtime off a
// colour map (townFolk.js, round 134's trick), and a vehicle is an easier
// subject than a person: no skin, no hair, just hull and trim. So colourway 1
// is the art as it was drawn and the other nine are turned from it on a canvas
// the first time anybody looks at one.
//
// PRICES ARE THE USER'S, IN THE USER'S UNITS. Written as `{ rank, amount }`
// and converted through inventory.js's own 100:1 ladder, so "50 bronze" in the
// brief is `{ rank: 'bronze', amount: 50 }` here and nothing has to be
// re-derived by hand into normal-coin units.

 * nothing but speed. "Some movements are more complex and require more
 * frames": the frames are there to show more of the motion, not to show the
 * same motion faster. So the RATE is constant and the CYCLE is as long as the
 * motion is complex.
