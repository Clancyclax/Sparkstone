// ============================================================================
// ROUND 66 -- ACT 0, AND THE DIVISION OF ESSENCE RESEARCH.
//
// DESIGN_STORY.md has carried this arc since round 43 and the game has never
// contained a line of it. Round 65's review put the honest number on that: the
// build had the STAGE for every act and the SCRIPT for none, and the four
// story characters -- the two researchers, the Essence Wraith and Rory
// Matheson -- were extracted, animated, loaded, and deliberately left standing
// backstage since round 46 on the principle that "a boss standing in a field
// with nothing to say is worse than no boss".
//
// This file is what gives them something to say.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE SCRIPT IS DATA AND THE MACHINERY IS NOT
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Round 64 built six objective kinds -- hunt, cull, survey, delve, gather,
// relic -- with target selection, progress hooks, a done test and a turn-in
// path, all asserted. Round 65 proved they carry authored content by running
// 224 god-quest steps through them without a second quest system.
//
// A story stage is the same trick again, with two kinds added that a bounty
// board never needed:
//
//   talk    -- stand in front of a named person and hear them out
//   search  -- find the thing in the room that is not furniture
//
// Both complete on an EVENT rather than on a counter, which is the only real
// difference between a plot and an errand.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT MAKES IT A STORY RATHER THAN SEVEN ERRANDS
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each stage rewrites what the LAB says. The Department is a chartered
// research house on stage 1 and a crime scene on stage 7, and the way the
// player learns that is by walking back in and finding the same two people
// saying something worse. Nothing is gated on a cutscene; the dialogue is the
// state machine's read-out.
// ============================================================================

// knowledge.js is pure data and imports nothing, so this cannot form a cycle.
import { KNOWLEDGE_BY_ID } from './knowledge.js';
// ROUND 102 -- both of these are pure data too, for the same reason. gods.js
// owns the roster the road-home offers are checked against; houses.js is Act
// 4's council, and its faults are folded into `divisionFaults` so one call
// answers for the whole story rather than two that can drift.

 * ACT 0 -- the waking.
 *
 * DESIGN_STORY.md: "The player wakes in a strange place with no idea how they
 * got there; the last thing they remember is going to bed at home. Knowledge
 * -- the goddess -- speaks into their mind: they have come to Pallimustus as
 * an outworlder, outworlders often have an outsized impact on the world, and
 * Pallimustus is dangerous. She gives a quick grounding in essences and
 * awakening stones and suggests that if they want to survive, they had better
 * get stronger for what is coming."
 *
 * Written as pages rather than a cutscene for two reasons: it reuses the
 * dialogue UI, which is tested, and it is skippable at any page, because the
 * fifteenth time you roll a character you do not want the sermon.
 *
 * `{NAME}` is substituted with the player's name. `{E1} {E2} {E3}` are
 * supported by _act0Text and DELIBERATELY UNUSED -- see the note on the
 * essence page for why naming the player's build back to them was wrong here.
 * The substitution stays because Act 1's dialogue will want it; if it is still
 * unused two rounds from now, delete it rather than leaving a fifth thing in
 * this codebase that is written and read by nothing.

// ROUND 82 -- ACT 0 IS TWO PAGES NOW, AND THEY ARE THE TWO IT ALWAYS WANTED.
//
//   "Instead of knowledge explaining everything to them right away the player
//    is forced to explore."
//
// The eight pages that stood here explained essences, awakening stones,
// confluences and the rank ladder to somebody who could not move yet and would
// not see any of it for an hour. Six of those pages MOVED rather than going:
// they became the sewer's tidbits, fired where the thing they explain was
// about to matter.
//
// ROUND 92 -- and they have moved once more, off the floor tiles and onto the
// events themselves (src/data/knowledge.js). A tile was still a guess about
// what the player had done; picking a thing up is not a guess.
//
// What is left is the two pages that were never exposition: waking up, and the
// hook. The player reads them and then wakes on wet brick in the middle of
// somebody's ritual circle, which does more of Knowledge's old job than
// Knowledge did.

  // ACT 4 -- BRATUGAL. The king, the council, and what was in the back room.
  // ==========================================================================
  //
  // This is the one act DESIGN_STORY.md wrote out in full, and it is built to
  // that outline rather than around it: the disappearances, the Division found
  // in town, the king's protection, the noble houses, the deposition, the
  // backup base in the far west, the wraiths that broke loose, Rory Matheson
  // in two phases, the child, and the gods.
  //
  // THE ONE STRUCTURAL DECISION: the houses and the council are two new stage
  // KINDS rather than a parallel system, for the same reason Act 2 was four
  // more stages instead of a second chain. `houses` completes when every house
  // is satisfied; `council` completes when the motion carries. Both read
  // src/data/houses.js, which holds no runtime state -- the favours live on the
  // player, so a save carries them with no new serialisation, exactly as
  // `divisionStage` does.

// heads back toward town -- and on the way EVERY GOD EXCEPT LIBERTY messages
// them, each asking that the child be brought to their own temple, each
// offering something incredible for the effort."
//
// This fires when the chain COMPLETES rather than as a twelfth Act 4 stage,
// and the distinction is the whole ending. A stage is a thing the player is
// asked to do. This is a thing that happens to them on the road afterwards,
// with no objective, no marker and nothing to accept -- and it is the last
// beat of the act precisely because there is nothing to do about it yet.
//
// LIBERTY IS SILENT AND THAT IS THE LOUDEST THING IN IT. Seven gods want the
// child. The one whose whole domain is not being owned by anybody does not
// ask, and nobody explains why, and the act ends there.
//
// `GOD_OFFERS` is keyed on gods.js's own roster so a god added or renamed
// there cannot leave a hole here -- `divisionFaults` checks the two lists
// against each other rather than trusting them to stay in step, which is fault
// class two (a table keyed off a list that does not cover the roster) and the
// one this codebase reproduces most.
