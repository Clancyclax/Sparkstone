// ===========================================================================
// ROUND 52 PHASE 2 -- CONDITIONAL SCALING.
//
// The user, choosing what to steal from the lore abilities: "Conditional
// scaling" first of four. Their own examples say what it should feel like:
//
//   "Doom awakening stone giving an ability dealing damage to a target equal
//    to their stamina after 15 seconds."
//   "Onslaught... Fire awakening stone generating fireballs."
//   "Apes together strong" -- the round-48 example, ally-count scaling.
//
// And the lore backs it: Farrah's Rising Flames climbs with each hit landed,
// Humphrey's clauses read "additional damage equal to...", Jason Asano's whole
// engine prices a blow by how many afflictions are already on the target.
//
// The shape of the mechanic is not the interesting decision -- a multiplier and
// a cap is a multiplier and a cap. The interesting decision is WHO DECIDES, and
// this file answers it the same way round 48 answered every other version of
// that question:
//
//        ESSENCE (the lever) -> WHETHER this ability grows under a condition
//        STONE   (the family) -> WHAT the condition IS
//
// A `raw` essence escalates because escalation is what Force means; whether it
// escalates with successive uses, with the target's remaining stamina, or with
// how far you have run is the stone's business. That is why the same essence
// feels different on two stones instead of feeling the same with a new colour,
// which is the complaint this whole run of rounds exists to answer.
// ===========================================================================

/**
 * The six conditions.
 *
 * `unit`      -- what one step of the condition IS, for the stats line.
 * `clause`    -- how the row reads. Takes the rolled numbers, returns English.
 * `needsTarget` -- evaluated against a specific enemy rather than the world.
 * `hint`      -- one line for the runtime evaluator, so the contract between
 *                this file and WorldScene._scalingMultiplier is written down in
 *                one place rather than inferred from a switch statement.

  // party does -- so the condition is read as the fight the target has LEFT IN
  // IT, which is its remaining health. The key keeps the name the design plan
  // gave it; the clause says health, because a row must not promise the player
  // a pool the runtime cannot see.
  //
  // ROUND 74 -- EACH MODE HAS THREE PHRASINGS NOW, and `clauses` is the list
  // `scalingClause` picks from on the ability's own seed.
  //
  // Round 62's rule is that no single sentence may be more than 5% of the
  // roster, because the user's complaint was recognising the same line over
  // and over. There are six scaling modes and one sentence each, so each
  // mode's share of the roster IS that sentence's share -- and round 74's
  // attack floor (item 5) pushed `selfDepletion` from just under the bar to
  // 5.89% simply by generating more attacks for riders to ride.
  //
  // Raising the threshold would have been the wrong repair: the guard was
  // doing its job and reporting a real loss of variety. Three wordings per
  // mode divides each share by roughly three instead, which is the thing the
  // rule was asking for. Every variant says the SAME mechanic -- the runtime
  // reads `scaleOn`, `scalePer` and `scaleCap` and has never read this text --
  // so they are interchangeable to the game and only different to read.
