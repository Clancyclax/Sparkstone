  // ===== ROUND 202 (item 3) -- `Stronger:` IS COUNTED, NOT RESTATED ========
  //
  // This used to print the whole clause list again with the numbers nudged, so
  // a gold aura's card carried the same seven clauses four times over:
  //
  //   Effect (silver): Adds: kills outright anything below 10% health.
  //     Stronger: enemies within 4.4 tiles gain a mark every 1.5s (up to 5);
  //     each mark makes them take 5% more damage; anything that attacks you
  //     from inside takes 15 damage back; you heal for 38% of the field's
  //     damage.
  //   Effect (gold): ... the same four clauses, at 4.9 tiles and 6 and 6%.
  //
  // It measured at 9.1% of all cards and it is the "one ability offered four
  // times" shape -- the same fault round 134 fixed for two abilities inside a
  // kit, here between four ranks of one ability. Every one of those numbers is
  // already on the card: `Numbers now:` prints the figures AT THE PLAYER'S
  // RANK, so a reader who wants the silver figure reads it there.
  //
  // What is worth saying is that the rank moved something and how many things
  // it moved, because that is the one fact the numbers line cannot give
  // (it shows one rank at a time). So the count survives and the restatement
  // does not.
  // ===== ROUND 204 (item 2.8.2 / 2.3.4) -- AND A COUNT IS NOT A SENTENCE ===
  //
  // The user, on round 202's answer: `"4 of its figures grow." makes no
  // sense`. It does not, and the reason it measured as an improvement last
  // round is that it replaced something worse rather than something good.
  //
  // What he asked for instead is explicit: "If it said Effect (bronze) and
  // said reduced enemy armor by an additional 10% on strike, or paces required
  // reduced by 50%, or cap increased to 48% any of those would be acceptable
  // ... abilities don't always have to get more complicated, they can just get
  // better (longer, more powerful, cheaper, faster)."
  //
  // So the clause is restated AT ITS NEW VALUE -- which is the concrete thing
  // he named -- and capped at two, which is what keeps round 202's finding
  // from coming back. That finding was never "do not restate a clause"; it was
  // that restating ALL SEVEN at each of four ranks printed one ability four
  // times. Two is enough to say what a rank did and short enough to read.
  // ===== ROUND 204c -- AND THERE IS NO `Stronger:` AT IRON ===============
  //
  // A census of 1,000 generated abilities found one real instance of the
  // user's sixth report of this fault, and it was not in a ladder: an IRON
  // card reading `Stronger: you pick things up from 80% further away.`
  //
  // Iron is diffed against the `normal` row -- a rank below the one every
  // character starts at, which no player has ever seen. So at iron the split
  // between "added" and "stronger" is a distinction the reader cannot make:
  // everything on that line is new to them. The clauses are real information
  // and are kept; they are simply listed as what the ability DOES rather than
  // as what it does better than a version that never existed.
  if (stronger.length && rank === ASPECT_RANKS[0]) {

 *

  // had a reader outside the two suites that assert it. The densest ability in

  // adds seventeen more transcriptions across three rounds, so the field they
  // all need is built before the first four rather than after the last.
